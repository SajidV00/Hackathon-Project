       "      'description': 'User Story: As an Admin , I want the system the system to include or exclude Shipping Charges and Tax for workflow determination  so that  a given document is routed to the appropriate Approvers for approval, ensuring a 100% compliance with our business processes. Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system takes the settings to include or exclude Shipping Charges and Tax on the Company → Workflow page and routes to the appropriate Approvers for approval. 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true  and  the new workflow rules feature toggle = true. Important Notes:   The new workflow enhancements will only be enabled for Maersk initially. For all other customers for whom this will be turned off, the existing functionality will prevail (for both Vroozi Invoice and Purchase). 3.  What pages should this change impact?  The documents themselves, when they are routed for approval. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Approvers. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. A document is ready to be submitted for approval  or  is already in the approval chain, manually or to be auto-submitted by the system. Exclude Tax Exclude Tax = On: The system excludes Tax from the workflow determination, that is, the system subtracts Tax from the Document Total. Exclude Tax = Off: The system includes Tax from the workflow determination, that is, the system does  not  subtract Tax from the Document Total. Exclude Shipping Charges Exclude Shipping = On: The system excludes Shipping from the workflow determination, that is, the system subtracts Shipping from the Document Total. Exclude Shipping = Off: The system includes Shipping from the workflow determination, that is, the system does  not  subtract Shipping from the Document Total. Approval Determination The system uses the finally computed Total to determine which Approvers should approve the document with everything else being the same. 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Potentially yes. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  In general, yes. But, existing documents for Maersk will not be impacted as they have turned these settings off, that is, Tax and Shipping are included by default for workflow determination. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Test Data: Approval Chain: Level Approver Approval Limit #1 John $80 #2 James $100 #3 Tim $110 #4 Jim $125 System Behavior: Total Tax = Tax (At footer) + Use Tax (At footer, if it is enabled) # Scenario Total Tax Total Shipping Document Total Document Total considered for approvers determination Approvers document is forwarded to… 1 Exclude Tax = Off Exclude Shipping = Off $10 $15 $125 $125 L1: John L2: James L3: Tim L4: Jim 2 Exclude Tax = On Exclude Shipping = On $10 $15 $125 $100 L1: John L2: James 3 Exclude Tax = Off Exclude Shipping = On $10 $15 $125 $110 L1: John L2: James L3: Tim 4 Exclude Tax = On Exclude Shipping = Off $10 $15 $125 $115 L1: John L2: James L3: Tim L4: Jim Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date # Question Recommendation Response Remarks Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 How should we handle existing documents that are already in the approval process? At every event, e.g. approve, submit, etc,. the approvals routing will be determined based on the latest settings. This is current state and it makes sense. None. 2 How should we handle the Withholding Tax and Use Tax scenarios? Do we need to add separate toggles? Both should be included or excluded. Both of these constitute the Total Tax being paid out by AP. Most customers will want both PR and invoice approval to mimic each other. 3 How should we handle Special Handling charges? Special Handling is inserted into the Shipping Charges. It will be included or excluded based on the Shipping Charges setting. There is no way to differentiate this scenario.

Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system showcases Purchasing Organization field and all of its associated messages only if this new feature toggle is enabled; otherwise, it is  not . 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true (and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, if memos are enabled). Note:  The feature toggle is applied to both invoices and memos alike. 3.  What pages should this change impact?  The invoice and memos pages. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?   Users who are allowed to create AP documents, namely, AP Processors, Managers, and Admins, will be able to update the Purchasing Organization field in   and    status, and Users who are allowed to view AP documents. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Purchasing Organization setting in Documents → Settings → All Documents is configured to one of Optional or Required. Default:  This feature toggle should be set to  off  for all existing and new customers, by default. Feature Toggle = Off When a user creates or views an AP document, the system does  not  showcase the Purchasing Organization field in the  line item  and in the  Audit Trail , and does not showcase any associated messages. Feature Toggle = On On the contrary, when a user creates or views an AP document, the system showcases the Purchasing Organization field in the  line item  and allows the user to make changes. The system also showcases any associated error messages above the line item section. The system reflects changes done to it in the  Audit Trail . 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes – both documents in process and historically processed documents. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date # Question Recommendation Response Remarks Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 How should we handle documents created between RC-2023-11 and RC-2024-1? The Purchasing Organization will be null if the feature toggle is off. Since the user is not explicitly setting it, it doesn’t make sense for the system to set it behind the scenes. None. 2 Identical to the question above, how should we handle the situation when the feature toggle is enabled initially and then disabled at a later point? The latest settings will take effect on documents being processed. This might not apply as the feature toggle will be deprecated when this is rolled out to Production. None.

When the user attempts to fill one manually, they are able to search and select Purchasing Organizations that are directly associated to the Company Code, from the drop down. General Rules: Custom Labels: If defined, the system showcases the Custom Label defined by the Admin for Purchasing Organization in Documents → Custom Labels; if not, the system showcases the default “Purchasing Organization“ label. Purchasing Organization = Hidden   (Current State) Errors:   The system does  not  display any errors related to Purchasing Organization. Transitions: There is impact to the transitions displayed as the Purchasing Organization is hidden from the user. Purchasing Organization = Required Errors:   If Purchasing Organization = blank/null, the system displays an error that the Purchasing Organization is missing, similar to the Plant missing error message. Transitions: The system displays the following transitions as a result of the Purchasing Organization being blank/null:  (Same behavior if Plant was missing) Park Assign Coding Question:  Does the system also show Exception Handling transition in this scenario? Purchasing Organization = Optional Errors: If Purchasing Organization = blank/null, the system does  not  display an error that the Purchasing Organization is missing. Transitions: There is no change in terms of the transitions that the system displays as a result of the Purchasing Organization being blank/null. Apply All: Important Note:  The system exactly mimics the behavior of the Apply All modal of PRs. Purchasing Organization = Hidden The system does  not  showcase the Purchasing Organization field in the Apply All modal. Purchasing Organization = Required The system showcases the Purchasing Organization field in the Apply All modal with a  Required  label. The user is  not  able to update other fields in the Apply All modal without updating the Purchasing Organization. Purchasing Organization = Optional The system showcases the Purchasing Organization field in the Apply All modal with no label. The user is able to update other fields in the Apply All modal without updating the Purchasing Organization. Audit Trail: Purchasing Organization = Required  or  Optional only The system showcases the updates to the Purchasing Organization as the user makes changes to it, after the initial transition. Note:  The implementation should mimic that of Company Code/Plant.  6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes – both documents in process and historically processed documents. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 Can we turn off Purchasing Organization from anywhere in the UI or back-end? No. Just the one in the Documents → Settings → All Documents. 2 Would this have any impact on Accounting Validation feature we built? Probably not. 3 How would adding the Purchasing Organization impact the Apply All modal? Should not have any unforeseen impact. 4 Where is the Purchasing Organization in the Purchasing Parties populated from? Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Do we need a add a feature toggle for this change? No, this can be released to all customers at the same time. 2 Should Purchasing Organization be added to the SP? No. This is not relevant for SP users. 3 How should we handle existing documents (documents in process + processed documents) when the change is released in Production? In   and   status, existing documents will reflect the latest configuration. 4 How should we handle documents in process when Purchasing Organization is enabled-disabled, after being enabled initially? In   and   status, existing documents will reflect the latest configuration. 5 How to handle the scenarios when Purchasing Organization = Hidden, that is, should Purchasing Organization = null in the database? Let it remain as-is. Unclear on what the customer expectations are in various scenarios. Understand customer expectations pre-release. 6 Do we need to consider the Accounting filtering feature toggle for the implementation? How does Plant filtering work? No. 7 Where should the Purchasing Organization error message be placed? Along with the Plant error message. Backlog Grooming (October 31, 2023): Attendees:  Jaro, Mavin, Ahmed, Aqsa, Zulkiful, Deepak Points of Discussion: Discussed the overall ticket, including the questions. Need to delve into questions #3, #4, #5 a little deeper. The following need to be covered in the ticket: User defaults. Custom labels. How Purchasing Organization field is filtered.',\n",

       "      'description': \"As an API user, we need to expose the feature to open a purchase order for re-invoicing when a memo is created. This can be achieved through the following ways: Acceptance Criteria: Reopen For Invoicing Field Support : The  reInvoicingOption  field should be exposed in the public API to manage the behavior of purchase orders when creating a memo. Allowed Values : The  reInvoicingOption  field should accept the following three values: REOPEN_PO (internal enum value: REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : This option allows the items in the memo to be available for invoicing, and the purchase order status will be changed to the previous status before it was invoiced. DONOT_REOPEN_PO (Internal enum value: DO_NOT_REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : This option ensures that the items won't be available for invoicing, and the purchase order status will remain unchanged. KEEP_AS_IS (internal enum value: ALLOW_REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : When this option is selected, the purchase order status will be kept as is, but the items will be made available for invoicing. Default Behavior : The value represents user selection for one of the options available for the re invoicing. If the user does not provide any value for this field, it should be null and not set.  The API should accept one of the supported values ( REOPEN_PO, DONOT_REOPEN_PO, KEEP_AS_IS ) in this field as the user selected value. If user does not provide any value in this field, it should not be set and user should be able to update this in the memo update scenario Accounts Payable Workflow (AP Workflow) :? Is this valid use case where the AP workflow is ON and we are creating the Memo from the API, since this will not trigger the AP workflow and Memo will be directly create in POSTED status from API. Do we need to add any validation in case of AP workflow ON, since we could add validation for supported values based on the AP settings If the AP settings support either PO reopen for invoicing or undetermined or both than the Memo creation is not possible without a user selection (purchaseOrderReInvoicingType will be mandatory in this case.) The public API documentation should be updated and following details should be provided into the  documentation. Development Tasks: Expose the  reInvoicingOption  field in the public API. Implement validation to ensure the field accepts the specified values. Implement default behavior based on AP workflow and CompanySettings. Update the documentation, and also update the minor version in the API documentation and add the change to release notes. Testing Tasks: Verify that the  reInvoicingOption  field is exposed in the API. Test that the field accepts the specified values ( REOPEN_PO, DONOT_REOPEN_PO, KEEP_AS_IS ). Validate that the default behavior is correctly determined based on the AP workflow and CompanySettings. Conduct thorough testing to ensure the feature works as expected. QA Testing Criteria: Verify that the API endpoints for creating memos have been updated to include the  reInvoicingOption  field. Confirm that the specified values are accepted and result in the expected behaviours. Validate that default behavior is correctly determined based on the AP workflow and CompanySettings. Perform end-to-end testing to ensure that creating a memo correctly impacts the purchase order re-invoicing. API documentation updated AC We need to update the API release notes and add on the top of the release notes following details. version of the API should be updated to 1.2.0 Memo[Memo](/#/Memos) APIs are updated to support Re Invoicing Options. The link should take the user to the Memo section in the documentation MemoModel should have the reInvoicingOption field\",\n",

The final PR should make the new components to be used in the page, so we don't break anything while continually merging the previous PRs\",\n",

       "      'description': 'Business Case : When an Invoice document is sent to a user for Exception Handling due to Accounting String errors or for Coding purposes (in general), then there should be a way for the next user (such as an AP user), viewing this document, to understand what changes were made by the previous user. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  Anybody who can view audit logs should be able to see this banner on the document and they should be navigated to the audit logs after clicking on this banner. Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true. What pages should this change impact?  The invoice page. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to handle exceptions and view audit logs. How should this change work? If the  Exception Handler  resolves the Accounting string errors by changing the accounting elements, and  submits  the invoice, then the system should showcase a new  Banner  indicating  Accounting Information Changes , which when clicked on, will open the  Audit trail  and highlight the line item Change Summary where the changes were made. If the  AP Coder  makes changes to the accounting elements in an Invoice, when it is in  Coding  or  Exception  status, then the same thing should happen as mentioned above. When should the Banner  show up ? After the  Exception Handler  or  AP Coder  has  submitted  the Accounting changes, when the Invoice was in  Exception  or  Coding  status. If there is an Audit Trail generated for the Accounting changes in the Change Summary section. Then ideally the Banner would show up in  Draft ,  Parked ,  Pending ,  Exception  (if all exceptions have not been cleared), and  Coding  status. When should the Banner  go away ? Once the Invoice is in  Approved,   Posted ,  Partially Paid  or  Paid  status. If there are  multiple  line items with Accounting changes then how should the Banner behave ? Show  all  line items with accounting changes separately in the Banner. Clicking each one of them takes the user to their appropriate audit trail Summary changes. ( Open to other suggestions if above solutions would hamper the performance. ) If the Invoice went through  multiple iterations  of Accounting Changes during Exception or Coding status, then how should the Banner behave? Show only the  last  update done for all line items with the accounting changes separately in the Banner. Clicking each one of them takes to their last updated audit trail Summary changes. ( Open to other suggestions if above solutions would hamper the performance. ) How should the Banner  look  like ? Banner Description  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions )- \" Accounting Changes Detected! Click here to Review Audit Logs \" \"Accounting Update: See Audit Logs\" \"Accounting Data Revised – Click here to Review\" \"New Accounting Data - Click here for Details\" \"Explore Accounting Changes in Audit Logs\" \"Review Audit Logs for Accounting changes\" Banner Color  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions ) - A suitable option could be  Purple  or a shade of  Magenta , as it\\'s distinct from the existing colors and often signifies changes or notifications. Teal  is distinct from the existing colors and is often associated with notifications and important updates. It can catch the user\\'s attention without being overly intense. Banner Icon Design  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions ) - A small  yellow triangle icon with an exclamation mark  inside the banner. This icon indicates that there\\'s an important change or action required. A small  bell icon  or a  speech bubble icon  inside the banner. These icons are commonly used to signify notifications and changes. A small  clock icon  similar to the Audit logs icon. This icon indicates that there are important changes in the Audit logs. Highlighting the line item changes in the Audit Trails  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions ) - Use the same  Gold Yellow border  over the Line item changes for every line item that had accounting changes.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  Maybe To which teams should this change be communicated to?

       "      'description': \"User Story: As an AP user , I want the Purchasing Organization to be included in the CSV posting file  so that  it can be integrated with my external system which is the source of truth. Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system includes the Purchasing Organization field in the CSV posting files. 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true. Note:  For those customers who process memos, ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true. 3.  What pages should this change impact?  None – the change impacts both invoice and memo posting files. Note:  This change does not apply to auto memos. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to post AP documents. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The CSV connector is enabled by the Admin. A document is in an   or   status, ready to be posted out of the system. Document Posting When a user or system posts a single/multiple documents, the system includes the Purchasing Organization in the posting file. The system showcases two fields for each document line item, as listed below. The positioning of these fields are  dynamic  based on the current implementation, that is, they can be positioned anywhere in the file (using the script). Purchasing Organization Code Purchasing Organization Description Note to QA:  Please ensure to test the dynamic positioning of the fields listed above, that is, verify if the Purchasing Organization fields can be positioned at any location in the file. The system displays the values as-is. The system leaves the fields above as empty/null if no Purchasing Organization is defined. 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes. A data script will be required to position the two Purchasing Organization fields at the far right of the posting file  for existing customers who will have CSV connector on at the time of executing the script in the respective environment . The data script may need to be executed in DEVQA, SOCI, PERR, and Production environments. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes, after the change is deployed in Production. Existing documents being posted will have Purchasing Organization in the CSV posting file but it will be blank/null. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date 1 5 Deepak December 6, 2023 Ahmed December 6, 2023 2 5 Deepak December 6, 2023 December 6, 2023 # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 Is the CSV file static or dynamic? None. Dynamic, based on  's examination of the code. 2 Is any Purchasing Organization attribute different from any of the other Organization or Accounting elements? None. No. Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Where should we place the Purchasing Organization in the CSV posting files? Not applicable. The posting file is dynamic, meaning that the fields can be positioned anywhere. 2 Should we consider if the Purchasing Organization is enabled or not, or if the new feature toggle is enabled? No. Purchasing Organization will be available to be displayed in the CSV posting files irrespective of feature toggles or settings. Unnecessary complication and it will have no affect if Purchasing Organization info is present in the file. If no value is present, the value will be blank. 3 Do we need to massage or localize the values prior to displaying the file? Do we need to consider the leading zeroes setting? No. We don’t currently take the leading zeroes into account for any posting mechanism. Backlog Grooming (December 6, 2023): Attendees:  Jaro, Mavin, Ahmed, Aqsa, Deepak Points of Discussion: Discussed the ticket overall. Assigned action items to Ahmed to: Understand if the CSV file is static or dynamic. Talk to Imran regarding leading zeroes and examine the code base. Sprint Planning (December 7, 2023): Attendees:  Jaro, Ahmed, Aqsa, Sujoy, Deepak Points of Discussion: Reviewed Ahmed’s findings. Made decisions on the decision points above.

No. Anyone who is able to edit a document in the above statuses should continue to do so. 2 Should we split the ticket for invoices and memos? No. The scope is manageable. 3 How should the system tackle  existing documents in the above statuses? Read only:  No validation will be done in these statuses, except   .

       "      'description': 'Business Case: The objective is to update the \"Manage Presets\" tab on the Apply to All modal to incorporate the Budgets field, ensuring it adheres to the same rules and patterns as on the main tab. This tab allows users to define and save combinations of values (using the same fields as on the main tab) with a unique name. These presets can then be used to auto-populate fields on the main tab. Specifics for the Manage Presets Tab: The Budgets field needs to be integrated following the same visibility and optional status rules as in the main Apply to All modal. Users should be able to define combinations of values including the Budgets field and other parent elements (Company Code, Purchasing Organization, Plant, Cost Center, GL Code). The system should allow these combinations to be saved with unique names. Presets should be recallable for auto-populating fields on the main tab. Acceptance Criteria: Integrate the Budgets field on the Manage Presets tab, ensuring it behaves consistently with its implementation on the main Apply to All modal. Enable users to create and save presets that include combinations of Budgets and its parent elements. Ensure each preset can be named uniquely and saved within the system. Allow these presets to be easily recalled and used to auto-populate fields on the main Apply to All modal. Verify that the implementation aligns with the visibility rules and behaviour of the Budgets field as specified for the main tab in',\n",

       "      'summary': 'Fix issues with the Budgets field on the new Apply to All modal',\n",
       "      'description': \"Business Case: The goal is to modify the behavior of the Budgets field on the Apply to All modal. This field is conditionally visible based on whether the Budgets functionality is enabled for the user's unitID. Once enabled, the Budgets field should always be visible on the Apply to All modal and be optional by default. Specific Use Cases: Changing Only the Budget : When a user selects a budget for the line items using the Apply to All modal, the system should display all active, non-deleted budgets from the user's company account. The user can search and select a budget without being required to fill other fields. The system should then evaluate if the selected budget matches the existing company and accounting info on the item. If it matches, the change is applied; if not, a warning message (as per   ) is shown. Changing Parent Elements of Budgets : If any parent element (Company Code, Purchasing Organization, Plant, Cost Center, GL Code) is altered, all these fields, including the Budget field, become mandatory. The system should then provide a list of budgets based on the combination of these parent elements. The user's specified combination is applied to all selected items without further validation, as the modal already ensures a valid combination. Acceptance Criteria: Modify the Budgets field visibility to always appear when the Budgets functionality is enabled. Ensure the Budgets field is optional by default. Implement a functionality to display all active, non-deleted budgets for selection. Enable a search feature within the budget selection list. Allow the application of a selected budget to all chosen items, with system validation against existing item data. In the case of only Budget being changed, display a warning message if the selected budget doesn't match the item's existing data, using the pattern specified in   . Ignore these original requirements.  Make Budget and its parent elements (Company Code, Purchasing Organization, Plant, Cost Center, GL Code) mandatory if any one of the parent elements is altered. When parent elements are also specified, provide a filtered list of budgets based on the combination of the parent elements specified by the user. Ensure the system applies the combination of changes to all selected items without additional validation in the case of parent element modification. The updated requirements; following the team’s discussion and review of the existing Budgets implementation on 01/22/2024, are documented below.  In the case of any one of the parent elements ( which includes Company Code, Purchasing Org, Plant, Cost Center, GL Code ) of the Budget field being modified by the user, the Budget field should automatically become required on the Apply to All modal. This will ensure that the Apply to All modal will always send a combination of the parent element, and a Budget to be applied to the selected line items.  The system should evaluate the user’s specified value for the parent element, against the company info + accounting info already present on the selected line items, one at a time. If the user’s specified value can be used with the data already present on a given line item, the system should update that field in said line item, with the user’s specified change. if it can’t be used, then the system should leave the line item as it is and display a warning message using the pattern specified in   . Once the parent element has been updated, the system should then evaluate the user’s specified value for the Budget field, against the data present on the line item. If it can be applied to the line item, then the system should update the Budget in the line item. Otherwise, the system should leave the Budget field blank on the line item, and show the user the standard “ Budget missing ” error message at the document level.  Additional information regarding the scope of work being covered in this ticket, as determined after discussion with QA: Purchase team will work off of the assumption, that the BE logic currently in the system; as of 01/22/2024, to fetch Budgets that can be used on a given line item, is working correctly. If there are any issues with that particular service’s behavior, it will be referred to and addressed by the Budget team.  Example scenario to clarify the above statement: If the user updates the values in the GL Code and Budget fields on the Apply to All modal; say he selects  GL1  and  BudgetABC , respectively.  The system will 1st evaluate  GL1  against the given Company Code data on the selected line item.  Assuming that  GL1  can be used with the given company code, the system will update the value of the GL Code field in the line item to  GL1 .  Next, the system will use the existing Budget fetching logic to get all active budgets that can be used with the combination of Company Code, Purchasing Org, Plant, Cost Center and GL Code on the line item. If the user’s specified Budget;  BudgetABC , is included in that list, the system will update the Budget field’s value on the line item to  BudgetABC . Alternatively, if  BudgetABC  isn’t part of that list returned by the system, then the budget field on the line item will be reset to empty, and the standard “ Budget missing ” error message will be displayed for that line item, at the document level.\",\n",

       "      'description': 'Goal Identify all areas in PMAN + SmartOCI that might be impacted due to Third-Party Cookies Phaseout Context Google Chrome has announced plans to begin disabling third-party cookies for 1% of users starting in the first quarter of 2024. This action is intended for testing purposes, with the process gradually scaling up to 100% of users, probably starting sometime in Q3 2024. Source:    Browsers such as Firefox and Safari have already phased out third-party cookies. Microsoft Edge, which is based on the Chromium engine, has not yet announced any changes, and for now, third-party cookies are allowed by default. It is crucial to ensure that Vroozi customers are not significantly impacted by these planned changes. Therefore, we need to identify all areas that might be affected by the disabling of third-party cookies. Note Adab mentioned that it has been reported that customers have already complained about Looker not working in Firefox and Safari -   . Tasks Compile the inventory of potential issues introduced by Third-Party cookies in the following Google Sheet:    Identify all potential issues along with the customers who might be impacted Ensure that we have testing steps to reproduce the functionality Audit cookies while executing testing steps (refer to:  https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd#audit ) Test for breakage (refer to:  https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd#test ). This is to simulate the state after the phase-out. Note: If we are unable to execute the audit or the test for breakage, we should ask the client to perform the test on our behalf. If the functionality will stop working, we need to prioritize the issue based on customer usage and the complexity of the solution Inventory sheet :',\n",

This enhancement aims to provide users with the ability to assign accounting splits based on quantity, value, or percent using the new Apply to All modal. We also want to enabled users to define presets with split accounting from the “Manage Presets” tab, and then use them from the “Changes to be Applied” tab.  Acceptance Criteria: Note: The behavior described in this ticket MUST work consistently on all line items, regardless of how they were added to the document: Manually via the “ Add Item ” function Shopping Cart Bulk Upload template UI Enhancement: A new field labeled \"Split Account Assignment\" should be added to the Accounting section of the Apply to All modal. The new field should have the following options: <blank>, \"None\", \"By Quantity\", \"By Value\", \"By Percent\", with <blank> as the default. Functionality for <Blank>: By default, the <blank> option should be selected.  Selecting this option should maintain the current UI state.

Upon application, the system should overwrite existing split accounting segments with the new data provided, making all fields in the Accounting section required. Functionality for \\'By Quantity\\': Selecting \"By Quantity\" should dynamically add at least two sets of accounting fields. Users should be able to add additional sets of identical fields. A required field labeled \"Quantity #1\", \"Quantity #2\", etc., should be added to each set. Upon application, the system should overwrite existing split accounting segments with the new data provided, making all fields in the Accounting section required. Functionality for \\'By Value\\': Selecting \"By Value\" should replicate the functionality of \"By Quantity\", replacing \"Quantity #n\" with \"Value #n\" fields. Functionality for \\'By Percent\\': Selecting \"By Percent\" should replicate the functionality of \"By Quantity\", replacing \"Quantity #n\" with \"Percent #n\" fields. Application of Changes: The system should evaluate if the user\\'s specified changes are compatible with each pre-selected line item. Compatibility for split accounting by quantity will be determined by comparing the sum of the quantities specified by the user, across all accounting segments, to the total order quantity of the selected line item. If the two values are equal, then the change can be applied, otherwise, the item must not be updated. Compatibility for split accounting by value will be determined by comparing the sum of the values specified by the user, across all accounting segments, to the total order value of the selected line item. If the two values are equal, then the change can be applied, otherwise, the item must not be updated. Compatibility for split accounting by percent will be determined by comparing the sum of the percentages specified by the user, across all accounting segments. if this sum adds up to “ 100 ”, then the change can be applied, otherwise, the item must not be updated.  Error Notification: If any of the user’s selected items were not updated, and the reason for that was related to the split accounting that the user was trying to apply. The system should display a persistent notification on the UI, informing the user about which items were not updated and providing a clear explanation of why they were not updated. This message should be displayed on screen using the pattern for document level warning messages; within the “ yellow ” panel.  If the user was trying to apply split accounting by quantity, this message should highlight the items that weren’t updated using the text “ < 1 > # < 2 > not updated. The sum of the quantities across all the accounting segments you specified, did not match the order quantity of < 3 >. “ < 1 > :  If there’s only one item in this list, then the system should use the word “ Item ”. But, if there are multiple items in this list, then the system should use the word “ Items “. < 2 > :  If there’s only one item in this list, then the system should only display the index number of that item and follow that with the word “ was ”. If there are multiple consecutive items in the list, the system use the pattern  [index number of the 1st item in the list] - [index number of the last item in the list]  and follow that with the word  “were“ . If there are multiple items in the list, but they’re not consecutive, the system should list the index numbers of all those items separated by commas, with the last item in that list being separated by an “ and ”.

But, if there are multiple items in this list, then the system should use the word “ these Items “.

So that users are able to change the value in as few as 1 individual field in the line items, using this mechanism. Additionally, Our system does not; currently, natively support many-to-many relationships between company info & accounting info master data objects.

This button should NOT be visible to any Employee user that has coding restrictions enabled in their user record.   The user can select one or more items before clicking the \"Apply to All\" button. Clicking the \"Apply to All\" button should open a modal dialog containing a dynamic form with multiple input fields. This modal should only show fields for the Org / Accounting elements that are enabled in the unitID.  By default, all input fields in the modal should be blank. All input fields in the modal should be optional for the user to fill in. The system should only allow a user to set values in these fields that are currently “_not deleted_” and active in the unitID.  Parent-Child Relationship: Some fields in the modal are considered parent elements, and others are considered child elements. If a user fills in a parent field, the system should restrict the user to selecting values in the child fields that are linked to the selected value in the parent field. This filtering mechanism must be driven off of the parent-child relationship of these elements in the unitID’s master data If a parent field has only one possible value for a child field, that value should be automatically filled in by the system. Mandatory Child Fields: If the user fills in a parent field, the system must make it mandatory for the user to fill in all linked child fields before allowing the changes to be applied to the selected items. Validation and Notification: Note: The requirements documented below mean that either the user’s entire set of specified changes will be applied to the line item, or nothing will be updated. There will not be a scenario where the user specifies changes to “ n ” child fields, but the system only updates some fraction of those “ n ” fields; as they were the only ones that would be valid with the existing parent field values on the line item. In this scenario, the entire set of specified changes will be discarded, and the user will be shown the appropriate error message. If the user is only updating child fields, the system should allow the user to apply changes. During the application of changes, the system must evaluate each selected item to determine if the user\\'s specified change can work with the values already provided in the selected item\\'s parent fields. If a user\\'s specified change is incompatible with the existing parent field values, that item should remain unchanged.

Once assigned, PR line items should automatically appear in the \"Ready for Sourcing\" queue of all associated Buyers. Retain the current email notifications sent to Buyers when they receive a PR line item in their \"Ready for Sourcing\" queue. The fields that play a role in the routing logic include: Product Categories, Suppliers, Company Codes, Cost Centers, GL Codes, Projects, and Locations. If any of these fields are left blank on the Buyer Group definition, ignore those attributes when matching a PR line item to a Buyer Group. In case multiple Buyer Groups match a PR line item, show an error prompting the user to manually select a Buyer Group. Evaluate if this is possible: Log any routing failures and roll the entire PR document back to its previous state.',\n",

In order to accomplish this, we need to add more parameters to the BuyerGroup definition.  Acceptance Criteria: Change this …  To this … General Changes from the existing modal: Remove the existing “ Click here to select all … “ links Move the existing “ Product Categories ” and “ Suppliers “ fields into their own section This section should be titled “ General Info ” Addition of new fields to the BuyerGroup definition: After the General section, add a new section called “ Company Info “ In this section, add a new type-ahead field for Company Codes After the Company Info section, add a new section called “ Accounting Info “ In this section, add new type-ahead fields for the following accounting objects: Cost Centers GL Codes Projects Locations General rules for the input fields: All the fields in the form, except for  Group Name  and  Group Description , should be optional If any of these fields are left empty, the effect should be the same as if the rule had been defined to work with any possible value for these fields.  All of the fields in the General Info, Company Info and Accounting Info sections should be type-ahead fields These fields need to be multi-select fields If the user clicks into the Company Codes field, they should see a list of all active, available master data objects for that specific field. If there’s no Company Code specified in the Buyer Group definition, when the user clicks into any of the Accounting Info fields, they should see a list of all active, available master data objects for that specific field. If there are one or more Company Codes specified in the Buyer Group definition, when the user clicks into any of the Accounting Info fields, they should see a list of all active, available master data objects for that specific field. However, these values should be filtered based on whether they’re linked to 1 of the specified Company Codes or not.  Clicking into any of these fields should  NOT  wipe out any of the previously selected values in that field.   Users should be able to manually remove individual selections from each of these fields by clicking on the “x” on that individual value’s “pill” If a selected value has been deactivated, or deleted from the unitID, the next time a user opens this modal, that value should be highlighted and the user should be informed of the change.  The following information was added on 12/01/2023 PKT: Help text to be used for each of the fields on this modal: Field Help Text New addition / Update to existing help text Associated Buyer(s) Please select the Buyers that you want to include in this group. If this Buyer Group is assigned to a line item, and the system evaluates that the line item should be routed into Vroozi BuyRoute, all the Buyers listed in this field will receive the item for sourcing.    Product Categories Please select the Product Categories you want to include in this group. This Buyer Group will be assigned to a line item, if the item is associated to one of the Product Categories selected in this field.    Suppliers Please select the Suppliers you want to include in this group. This Buyer Group will be assigned to a line item, if the item is associated to one of the Suppliers selected in this field.    Company Codes Please select the Company Codes you want to include in this group. This Buyer Group will be assigned to a line item, if the item is associated to one of the Company Codes selected in this field.   Cost Centers Please select the Cost Centers you want to include in this group. This Buyer Group will be assigned to a line item, if the item is associated to one of the Cost Centers selected in this field.    GL Codes Please select the GL Codes you want to include in this group. This Buyer Group will be assigned to a line item, if the item is associated to one of the GL Codes selected in this field.    Projects Please select the Projects you want to include in this group. This Buyer Group will be assigned to a line item, if the item is associated to one of the Projects selected in this field.    Locations Please select the Locations you want to include in this group. This Buyer Group will be assigned to a line item, if the item is associated to one of the Locations selected in this field.    The following information was updated on 12/21/2023 PKT: # Question Answer 1 Which fields should be shown on this modal? Only those fields should be visible on this UI, which the unitID is configured to use. 2 if an accounting object is enabled in the unitID, but configured as “Hidden” in the line item configs, should the Admin be able to define a Buyer Group based on that accounting object?  Except for the GL Codes, the answer would be yes. As these accounting objects can be configured in each requester’s user profile, even if the relevant fields are hidden on the UI at run-time.  3 Should the BuyerGroup definition apply any filtering logic when allowing an Admin to specify values in the fields?  Yes. But only if the BuyerGroup definition includes 1 or more Company Codes. If it does, then all child fields should present values filtered by the specified company codes. E.g. Each Cost Center in the list of options that the Admin can pick from, should be linked to at least 1 of the Company Codes that have been specified.  4 Should the BuyerGroup be updated on line items when a user updates the company info, or accounting info on that line item via the “Apply to All” function?  Yes. When the company info, or accounting info on a line item is updated via the “Apply to All” function, the system should evaluate whether the existing BuyerGroup assignment can work with the new information or not. If it can, then the existing assignment should be left as it is. If it can’t, then the system should fetch a new BuyerGroup based on the new information available on the line item.  5 Related to the question above, what should happen in the case of split-accounting being applied to the line item?  If the line item has split accounting applied to it, then the system should base the BuyerGroup assignment on the 1st split segment in the line item’s accounting info section.  6 What should happen if there are multiple BuyerGroups applicable to the line item?  Since the Buyer Group field is optional on the line item modal, we will leave that as it is. So …  - If the BE doesn’t return any Buyer Groups, leave this field empty - If the BE returns 1 Buyer Group, auto-select that value in this field - If the BE returns >1 Buyer Groups, auto-select the 1st value from that list in this field',\n",

       "      'description': 'Business Case : Currently, our system encounters a challenge when an Invoice returns from Exception Handling with an accounting string error after the Goods Receipt has been created. The system lacks a defined process for handling such accounting validation exceptions during this stage. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  If an accounting validation error is detected during the return of an Invoice from Exception Handling after the Goods Receipt has been created, the system should recognize this scenario and accordingly automate the Exception Handling process further. Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTING_STRING_VALIDATION = true. What pages should this change impact?  Invoices in Exception status. Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Processor / AP Manager / Exception Handling group users. How should this change work? Detection of Accounting String Error : If an accounting validation error is detected during the return of an Invoice from Exception Handling after the Goods Receipt has been created, the system should recognize this scenario. Auto-Processing Rule Evaluation : The system should check the Auto-Processing rule configured for cXML and Supplier Portal invoices. Decision Making for Supplier Portal & cXML created Invoices : Based on the Auto-Processing rule, the system should determine whether the Invoice requires further attention by an Exception Handling group or can proceed to the next stage. Invoice created from Auto create invoices from Supplier Portal / cXML toggle GR Exception toggle Accounting String Error toggle Accounting String Error found? Decision Supplier Portal / cXML ON ON ON Yes GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  ANY  Accounting String Error,  Send Invoice to the User Group/Type selected for Accounting String Error for resolving the exception. The Assigned Exception Handler is allowed to resolve Accounting String Errors. The Assigned Exception Handler is able to return the Invoice back to AP. Supplier Portal / cXML ON ON ON No GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  NO  Accounting String Error, Follow current implementation. Supplier Portal / cXML ON ON OFF Yes GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  ANY  Accounting String Error,  Return Invoice back to AP and assign the Invoice Owner or AP Processor / Manager group depending on the Access rules. ( how it works currently in the system ) The AP user should see the Accounting string error. The AP user is allowed to send the Invoice for Exception handling in order to resolve the Accounting String Errors. Supplier Portal / cXML ON ON OFF No GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  NO  Accounting String Error, Follow current implementation. Decision Making for Invoices created manually by AP User : Invoice created from GR Exception Accounting String Error found? Decision Hopper or Manually by AP user. Yes Yes GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  ANY  Accounting String Error, Return Invoice back to AP and assign the Invoice Owner or AP Processor / Manager group depending on the Access rules.

Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  Re-trigger Accounting string validation when the Pending Invoice is loaded/refreshed. Incorrect accounting strings should be flagged and correct accounting strings should have the error message removed. Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTING_STRING_VALIDATION = true. What pages should this change impact?  Invoice in  Pending  status. Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Approvers with  or  without AP Coder  or  Edit AP documents during approval role. How should this change work? Pre-Requisites: Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. AP Processor / Manager submits the Invoice for Approval to the AP Approver. If the Accounting information on the invoice becomes invalid after the Invoice has been submitted then - The system re-triggers accounting validation for all  incorrect accounting strings  when the AP Approver accesses the Invoice - for the  first time  or; refreshes  the Invoice page if it was already open  or; if they had  AP Coder  /  Edit AP documents during approval  role and tried to update the accounting information using the calculator / pencil ( this already works seems like )  or; when they click on  Approve  /  Approve and Forward  button . The system discards the accounting string errors pertaining to the ones that are deemed valid. The system continues to display the accounting string errors pertaining to the ones that are still invalid. Currently, in this ticket -  , we are not handling accounting validation on Invoices in Pending status proactively. That's something we need to  extend  to Pending status as well. Reference ticket -   where accounting validation was done for certain Invoice statuses. 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  No, as this functionality is not available in Production. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams.

       "      'description': \"Client - Please see attached email. To summarize, we have several users calling in from multiple locations reporting that their default company code and/or default shipping address are loading incorrectly on new purchases. We think it may be only an issue on Catalog purchases but not 100% sure about that. As an example, look at user Mauricio Martinez. His default company is set to C1-031 but on the attached Word doc you can see it is populating as H1-060. Additionally, his default shipping address is loading incorrectly. This is much more serious. With the company code being wrong it is not allowing them to move forward if they don't have access to that company. But with the ship-to wrong and users not aware and being used to this always loading as their default, I am worried this could result in numerous purchases company-wide being shipped to the wrong places causing us not only delays in getting what we need but also to incur significant monetary expenses to correct and re-ship everything where it needs to go ... so we to give this the highest priority and get it resolved as quickly as possible. Support Team: When was this user's profile updated last time ? I don’t believe I have updated it since it was created although I viewed it today. It seems like some changes have been made to users’ profiles maybe through imports or something backend as I see a lot of things have changed I don’t remember changing, specifically associated company codes being populated. Were there any Company Code restrictions added / removed from the user's profile? If yes, then which company code and when was this change made ? No changes that I am aware of, see answer above to  #1 . Which other users are having this issue so that we can compare their profiles and see what is common between them ? Chris Trahan, William Koenig, all users. The Shipping address in Mauricio's default setting and on the PR 1000127600 are the same. Is there an example where the wrong shipping address was selected ? That’s probably because he manually changed it. On new purchases it is defaulting incorrectly. Some users will be astute enough to change it, some will not. Can you provide more PR examples if possible where users are getting the Shipping Address or Company Code issue ? If more issue are reported I will forward. Please consider this issue has URGENT Priority . Development Team: this issue is occurred due to user bulk upload and this is System bug. According to the current implementation,  System get first cost centre from the DB using provided cost centre code in the file, System doesn't check its configured with provided company code or not. this issue only happened if single cost centre is configured against multiple company codes. As you can see in the screenshot, this was implemented in 2015.\",\n",

When providing the filter options, all the fields are optional. Id dates are provided than the following conditions should be considered only lastUpdatedAfter is provided in the filters, Return all results after this date, if the date is provided in date only format, consider the time of end of the day, e.g 01/29/2024 is provided than filter all records after 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000  only lastUpdatedBefore is provided in the filters, Return all results before this date, if the date is provided in date only format, consider the time of start of the day, e.g 01/29/2024 is provided than filter all records after 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 If both the dates are provided than consider the records between provided date ranges. If the date are provided in date only format, consider the following rule (lastUpdateAfter - lastUpdatedBefore). e.g  01/27/2024 t 00:00:00.000 - 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 will filter all the records from the 01/28/2024 If the fields are provided in wrong format, than we need to provide use with validation error, end date cannot be before start date.  the result will be empty, since there is nothing in the provided range e.g selecting (lastUpdateAfter - lastUpdatedBefore). e.g 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 - 01/27/2024 t 23:59:59.999 will return no result as there is nothing in between these dates (One suggestion could be to give a validation error, since this is not a correct date range.) Sort by should be by the last updated date field. Update the Vroozi API documentation to expose these additional query parameters. Dates should be accepted in the supported formats.

The supported file extensions are : [.csv, .tsv, .xlsx, .zip, .war] To add catalog items to an existing catalog, use the provided template. The upload process is asynchronous, allowing you to continue other tasks without interruption. Ensure your catalog data is saved in supported formats: [.csv, .tsv, .xlsx, .zip, or .war]. Fill in the template with your item details, and upload the file. You can additionally provide the image file to associate with each item in the file. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation or reach out to the system administrator for assistance.

In case only 1 item is updated in the catalog upload sheet (using “Merge & Update” method), still all the line items are moved into the history table and a new version is saved in the catalog table . This causes the history table to expand rapidly each time there is even a minor change in the catalog items. Use Case is: If a catalog has around 100,000 items Change price in 1 line item All items will have new lastUpdatedDate As there is no change in other items except 1. Implementation is updating all items. So it should only be updated and pushed into history with 1 item. Since we have a limited number of rows quota now. So based on the current implementation we can’t move with this collection into redshift for replication. We may have to rethink the architecture that we have designed. Acceptance Criteria: Change the implementation, so that:  Instead of recording details about the entire catalog being edited, the system should ONLY record details of the items; within the catalog, that have been modified/added/deleted.  This new design needs to cover Overwrite All & Merge and update scenarios We need to handle catalogs in the WORKING column in the catalog manager. Catalogs can only be edited in that column. Modifying a catalog in the other columns is ONLY possible by either creating a “working” copy, or uploading a new file … which then creates a working copy.  cc:  ,  ,  ,    QA  ONLY  needs to test the data replication from MongoDB to Amazon Redshift. There will be  NO  change to the change history report generated from the smartOCI Admin UI.   How to test this? There is a new DB collection, and that’s all we need to look at. Only items that have been deleted from, or updated in a catalog should be added to that collection. Items that have NOT been modified, should NOT be part of that new collection.',\n",

Restarting mongo-connector also does not work unless we track and update this data. For right now we can produce this scenerio from invoice creation screen which is discussed in this ticket  . While the suggested validation in this ticket fixes the problem we need to identify and fix within mongo connector as well to support out of range dates or at least it should not crash and stop working. Reason for error: As mentioned in the official pyMongo documentation here at  https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/4.2.0/faq.html#why-do-i-get-overflowerror-decoding-dates-stored-by-another-language-s-driver  that this is a driver issue. The updated driver fixes this problem as mentioned here at  https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/4.3.2/faq.html#why-do-i-get-overflowerror-decoding-dates-stored-by-another-language-s-driver  by creating the MongoClient with customised date options. We need to solve this problem by using the pyMongo version 4.3.2 and then updating the native mongo-connector code to create MongoClient as mentioned in the documentation.  Both pyMongo versions are supported by mongodb 6 version as mentioned in the official documentation here at  https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/#compatibility-table-legend . Both pyMongo versions are also supported by python 3.8 which we are using for mongo-connector as mentioned in the official documentation here at  https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/#language-compatibility . Fixation steps Update pyMongo from  4.2.0 to 4.3.2 Open connector.py file located at  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mongo_connector/connector.py  and update the code as follows (updated file is also attached in this ticket) import  from bson.codec_options import DatetimeConversion  → around line 42 (file attached as well in the ticket) line number around 336 → replace code snipped as  https://github.com/yougov/mongo-connector/pull/938/commits/b2f96d3ed5c7fc5cc527567cff60a1f5a76fb648 client = MongoClient(new_uri, tz_aware=self.tz_aware, **kwargs) //original code\\nclient = MongoClient(new_uri, tz_aware=self.tz_aware, \\ndatetime_conversion=DatetimeConversion.DATETIME_CLAMP, **kwargs) //replacement Restart Mongo Connector.

Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  The system should perform uniqueness check in order to update an existing Approval Rule. Which Customer should this change impact?  All customers using the new Approval Workflow feature toggle. What pages should this change impact?  Company > Workflow > Approval Rules. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins. How should this change work? The system will determine the uniqueness of the Approval Rule by examining the Rule Name and considering the following use cases to determine whether the Approval rule being added via Bulk upload is a new rule or an existing rule that requires updating: - Bulk upload file contains a  new  rule : Rule Name , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does not exists  in the database. Approval Rule  does not belong to the  same  document type (Applies to) if the Combination of Conditions(s) or Approval Chain is the  same  to an existing Approval Rule. Example 1 :  Rule  = Exists in the system;  Rule Name  = Test 1;  Applies To  = PR, CR;   Condition(s)  = Company Code A + Plant A;  Approver(Approval Limit)  = Sujoy (100), Deepak (200). Rule  = New rule added in through Bulk upload;  Rule Name  = Test 2;  Applies To  = Invoice, Memo;   Condition(s)  = Company Code A + Plant A;  Approver(Approval Limit)  = Sujoy (100), Deepak (200). Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does not exist  in the database. Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file, are valid, non-deleted and active. Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does not overlap  with an Existing Parent-Child combination(s). ( Similar to how existing implementation will check for a given combination of filter that is already in use by a workflow ) System assigns the  status  based on the use cases mentioned in this ticket -    Bulk upload file contains an  existing  rule : Rule Name , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does exists  in the database. Do not update existing Approval Rule  if - No changes in document type (Applies To). No changes in Rule Description. No changes in the Combination of Condition(s). No changes in the Approval Chain. No changes to the Status of the Approval rule. No changes to the Deleted option for the Approval rule, in the Bulk upload file. Update existing Approval Rule  if - Changes in document type (Applies To). Changes in Rule Description. Changes in the Combination of Condition(s). Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does exist  in the database. Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file, are valid, non-deleted and active. Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file,  should not overlap  with an Existing Parent-Child combination(s). ( Similar to how existing implementation will check for a given combination of filter that is already in use by a workflow ) Changes in the Approval Chain. Note : Approvers should have proper user role, non-deleted, and active. Changes to the Status of the Approval Rule. Check the use cases mentioned in this ticket -    Changes to the Delete option for the Approval rule, in the Bulk upload file. Data provided, in the Bulk upload file, is Invalid or Incorrect : Throw an error for the Approval rule, to the user, explaining the reason for rejecting the Approval rule. Prompt the user to correct the data and re-upload correct data. Refer to the Error report ticket for more details -    User provides the same Approval rule multiple times in the Bulk upload file : Example : Rule 1 and Rule 2. If Rule 1 and Rule 2 are exactly the  same , then Check  “ Bulk upload file contains a  new  rule ”  use case . If it satisfies the above condition, then create a  new  Approval rule for  Rule 1 , and throw an  error  for  Rule 2 , to the user, in the Error report citing “ Duplicate Row Error ”. Check  “ Bulk upload file contains an  existing  rule ”  use case . If it satisfies the above condition, then  update  the existing Approval rule, using data provided in  Rule 1 , and throw an  error  for  Rule 2 , to the user, in the Error report citing “ Duplicate Row Error ” and hence ignore the duplicate data. Check  “ Data provided, in the Bulk upload file, is Invalid or Incorrect ”  use case. If it satisfies the above condition, then throw an  error  for  Rule 1  based on the various  error messages  provided in   or based on the  current implementation , that is present on the UI. Throw an  error  for  Rule 2 , to the user, in the Error report citing “ Duplicate Row Error ” and hence ignore the duplicate data. If Rule 1 and Rule 2 have  same   Rule Name  but  different   information  such as - “Applies To / Rule Description / Combination of Condition(s) / Combination of Approval Chain / Status / Delete” from each other, then Consider  Rule 1  as the  main data  and throw an  error  for  Rule 2 , to the user, in the Error report citing “ Duplicate Row Error ” and hence ignore the data provided in Rule 2. Check  “ Bulk upload file contains a  new  rule ”  and  “ Bulk upload file contains an  existing  rule ”  use case for  Rule 1  to see which use case it satisfies.

All customers using the new Approval Workflow feature toggle. What pages should this change impact?  Company > Workflow > Approval Rules. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins. How should this change work? There should be an Upload Approval Rules icon above the top right corner of the Approval Rules table on the Approval Rules screen. ( The following image is just for reference. ) Hovering on the icon should show a tooltip saying Upload Approval Rules. Clicking on the Upload Approval Rules should open a window where users can select and upload the bulk upload file. Upon Selecting the file, the system should validate the bulk upload file to verify all the data is valid. In case of valid data in the bulk upload file, the system should save the Approval Rules uploaded via bulk upload in the DB. There should be a green noty message stating that the file has been uploaded successfully. They should start appearing in the Approval Rules table. If there are errors in the files, the system should generate an error report which the user can download. (refer to the ticket -  ). There should a red noty message stating that the file has been failed to upload or there are errors in the file. Here is the attached template file that should be used for the Approval Rules bulk upload. There is one optional column  Delete   in the bulk upload file. It is a flag type - (true or false). The user can use it to delete the existing record in the system through bulk upload. The user can provide  X   in the column to mark the  DELETED  flag true. The Approval Rule with the  DELETED  flag  true  should be soft-deleted and kept in the DB. The system should keep it in the DB with the  DELETED  flag true if the user marks the  DELETED  flag true for the Approval Rule that has never existed in the system before. Please open the  Instructions  of the attached sheet to understand the validations of each field (column) present in the bulk upload file. As an example for Company Code column, Admin can use any one of the below formats during  Upload : Company Code A Company Code A, Company Code B Company Code A | Company Code A description Company Code A | Company Code A description, Company Code B | Company Code B description Similarly other Accounting objects like - Plant, GL Account, Cost Center, Location and Project should be able to follow the same format as shown above for  Upload . The column names (fields) should be  case-insensitive . The system should support  custom labels  for accounting and company objects in the bulk upload file as column (field) names.  ( For now we’ll skip custom label support for accounting objects which we can focus in a future release like RC-2024-4 or RC-2024-5 ) The system should support bulk upload file in .XLSX format.

       "      'description': 'Business Case: The system should run accounting validation when the PR is assigned to the awarded bid on the RFQ. Acceptance Criteria: Existing Implementation of RFQ: The user creates the RFQ with line items and sends the RFQ to one or more suppliers. The suppliers receive that RFQ via email. The suppliers then bid on the RFQ. The user who created the RFQ can see the bids from different suppliers on the RFQ. The user then can award the bid to one of the suppliers. The user then can assign the PR to the awarded bid. The system creates the PR in the DRAFT state in the background and assigns it to the selected requester. While creating the PR, the system assigns the accounting and organization objects from the selected user’s profile. If the accounting and organization objects are not found in the user’s profile, the system leaves the accounting and organization fields empty. The system shows the missing fields error message according to the document-level field configuration. General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Creation: Currently, the system requires the definition of the required and optional Accounting/Organization objects in the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service . If the value in the optional field is given at the line item, the system considers it for the accounting validation in addition to the required fields. If the value in the optional field is not given at the line item, the system considers only the values in the required fields at the line item for the accounting validation. Based on that, the system decided what fields should be compared in the accounting validation with the accounting string master data. Assign PR to the Awarded Bid of RFQ: The system creates the PR in the DRAFT state and assigns it to the selected requester when the PR is assigned to the awarded bid of the RFQ. While creating the PR in the background: The system should not run the accounting validation if the selected user default accounting/organization values are not set in the user’s profile. In that case, when the requester opens(loads) the PR, the system should show the missing fields error message according to the document-level field configuration.   The system should not run the accounting validation if it does not find values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  in the selected user’s profile.  In that case, when the requester opens(loads) the PR, the system should show the missing fields error message according to the document-level field configuration.

Note : When we hit at the same time only 150 records created with completed and rest of all the request in the response payload is working fine but when verify in db it state is IN_Progress but records are not created/ updated. This may be an issue in system. When we removed the item number in the csv file and upload it through API it gives us the validation error on UI. so user can pass any number in the item number it will not take this user provided number but system generates number automatically against line item  so i think this is incorrect behaviour we have to look into this one i already discuss with   bhai about this scenario.

If the date is provided in date only format, consider the following rule (lastUpdateAfter - lastUpdatedBefore). e.g 01/27/2024 t 00:00:00.000 - 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 will filter all the records from the 01/28/2024 If the fields are provided in the wrong format, then we need to provide a validation error, the end date cannot be before the start date.  Sort by should be by the last updated date field. Update the Vroozi API documentation to expose these additional query parameters. Dates should be accepted in the supported formats.

       "     'description': 'Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( — ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal.

       "      'description': 'Business Case: The purpose of this ticket is to address the need for an enhanced user interface within the Vroozi Admin system for displaying custom Terms & Conditions (T&Cs). The current UI for T&Cs is slated for replacement to improve usability, functionality, and visual appeal. This enhancement is expected to facilitate easier navigation and management of T&Cs for administrators, particularly in the context of different unit IDs. By introducing a new table format, administrators can efficiently view, manage, and understand the specific T&Cs associated with each unit ID, leading to better compliance management and a more user-friendly experience. What’s wrong with the current UI?   The current UI is only meant to handle a single set of custom T&Cs for a unitID. It displays a single rich text editor, which allows the Admins to define the custom T&Cs that the unitID will use. This bakes in the assumption that there will always be just one set of T&Cs that will be used across all POs that the unitID issues to all suppliers.  What value will the updated UI bring? This new UI will be inspired by other data tables used in the application, specifically the ones used on the various document status screens. E.g. Purchase Orders. This will enable the display, creation, deletion, editing of an arbitrary number of custom T&Cs that an Admin might want to maintain for the unitID.  The data table format will allow the system to list any number of custom T&Cs for the unitID. Allowing the Admin to perform various operations on these T&Cs, either on a singular basis, or collectively. The new UI will support standard CRUD functionality, and will even grow to offer bulk upload/download functionality.  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: If the feature flag added in   has not been removed from the system. Then the unitID MUST have this feature flag enabled.    Impacted Vroozi Roles Which user roles within the Vroozi Admin system will be affected by this change? PMAN Admin Data-Fix Necessity   Will there be any requirement for data migration or transformation as part of this change? TBD … If required, please provide details of what the expected effect of this data fix will be:  TBD … Change this …  To this …                                                                                +  Ignore the following UI elements from the wireframes for the scope of this ticket: The Bulk Upload/Download UI controls The Default Terms & Conditions label and drop-down The search/filter bar Default set of requirements for the new data table: When a user clicks into the existing “ Terms & Conditions “ drop-down and selects the “ Custom Terms & Conditions “ option, the system should display a new data table, with the following columns:  <Row selection checkboxes> Name Description Associated with …  Created by Created on Status <Row action controls> The following columns should be sortable:  Name Created by Created on There should be 3 action buttons under the data grid:  Activate Deactivate Add T&Cs How should the system behave when there are no custom T&Cs available in the unitID? If there are no custom T&Cs currently created for the unitID, the system should display a placeholder message in lieu of the rows in the table. This message should read “ Could not find any existing custom Terms & Conditions. Please create a new set of Terms & Conditions by clicking on \"Add T&Cs\".  “ Unless there is at least 1 set of custom T&Cs in the data table, only the “ Add T&Cs ” button should be in an active/clickable state.  How should the system behave when 1 or more custom T&Cs are available in the unitID? By default, the system should display custom T&Cs on this data table, sorted by creation date; i.e. the “ Created on  “ column, in reverse chronological order (latest → oldest). The  Name  field should display the mandatory name assigned to each set of custom T&Cs.  The value displayed in this column should be clickable The  Description  field should display upto 50 characters from the optional description in each set of custom T&Cs, if available.  The  Associated with …  field should display upto 3 of the suppliers and/or company codes that the custom T&Cs are associated with.  If there is a single supplier and/or company code that the custom T&C is associated with, then the system should just list those values. If there is nothing to show, display an “ N/A ”. For 2 or more values display the keyworkd “Multiple ( x )“; where “x” is the number of values that were returned by the BE.  Upon clicking on this keyword, the system should display a list of the values represented by the count in the (), in a too-tip. See the implementation on the Purchase Orders data grid for ference.  The associated suppliers should be listed first, followed by the associated company codes in the next line.  The  Created by  column should list the name of the user that created a given set of custom T&Cs.  The  Created on  column should list the date on which a given set of custom T&Cs was created in the unitID. This field should use the same default date format used in the entire unitID.  The  Status  column should display one of the following statuses for each row: Active Inactive Question Answer Q asked by …  Q asked on … A provided by … A provided on … What symbol should be added to the last column’s header in the new table? Leave the header empty for now. If needed, I’ll create another ticket to add a symbol there.          What are the options that we will show in the action menu in the last column in the new table? Ultimately, I want 3 options in the menu: Make these the default T&Cs  Copy Delete However, this will be handled in a separate ticket. For now, just make sure there’s an extra column at the end of the table, that we can use to give the user options for performing actions related to a given set of T&Cs.',\n",

When creating conditions that trigger workflows, company\\nAdmins can create more granular conditions by adding more organizational and\\naccounting objects that are not seen as Duplicate Approval Rule. Previously, admins\\nfaced restrictions when creating approval rules that belonged to the same accounting\\nfamily (eg: approval for a cost center, and approval for the same cost center plus GL).\\nAdmins can create multiple conditions, but if the system identifies multiple approval\\nrules that apply to a document, it will default to the Fallback AP Approver for approval.\\n\\n**[Image here]**\\n\\nNote: This applies to customers using Vroozis Dynamic Workflow. Customers who do\\nnot have the Dynamic Workflow feature enabled will need to contact the Support Team\\nto activate it.\\n\\n## NEW DYNAMIC WORKFLOW FOR PAYMENT REQUESTS\\nCustomers using Payment Requests and the Dynamic Workflow will see the option to\\nselect Payment Requests when configuring the workflow rules.\\n**[Image here]**\\nTo enable the Dynamic Workflow for Payment Requests, contact Vroozi Support or\\nCustomer Success.\\n**[Image here]**\\n## AUTO INVOICE DATE CALCULATION BASED ON RECEIPTS - SUPPLIER BULK UPLOAD CONFIGURATION AND TRACK CHANGES IN THE SUPPLIER HISTORY\\nIn the previous release (March release), Vroozi introduced a new toggle in the Supplier\\nMaster Record to enable Auto Invoice Date Calculation.

Preconditions: MAERSK FT should be enabled in the DB. CoCe A with ACSV001 code should be associated with CC A and CoCe B with ACSV001 code should be associated with CC B. Steps to Reproduce: Upload an Approval Rule file containing new Approval Rule with CoCe A i.e ACSC001 and CC A. Please see Error report generated containing error “invalid data format..“. Actual result: The system tries to find the first cost center with the Code ACSV001, which is incorrect.  Expected Result: It should, instead correctly associate the mentioned Cost Center against the Company Code since specified in the Approval rule. The similar approach should be following for other accounting elements that allow the same code. Thanks, Asma',\n",

       "      'description': \"Business Case : As an  Admin , I want the system to determine approval rules based on the accounting combination with the  highest total amount  across  all line items , rather than solely relying on the first line item's accounting combination. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  Modify the Approval Matching Technique to consider the accounting combination with the  highest total amount  across  all line items , rather than the current implementation where approval rule selection is based solely on the first line item's accounting combination. Which Customer should this change impact?  Customers using the new  Dynamic Approval Workflow  feature toggle and  new BE setting  /  Option (b)  from this ticket -  . Important Notes: The new workflow enhancements will only be enabled for Maersk and Forest Lawn initially. This solution was specifically designed to handle Maersk’s 1st line item matching concerns. For all other customers for whom this will be turned off, the existing functionality will prevail (for both Vroozi Invoice and Purchase). What pages should this change impact?  PR, CR, Invoice, Memo, PRQ. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins, Approvers, AP Approvers. How should this change work? Pre-Requisites: Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. Overview : The change involves enhancing the Approval Matching Technique to consider the accounting combination with the highest total amount across all line items when determining the appropriate approval rule for a document. Functionality : When a document is submitted for approval, the system should analyze  all line items  to identify unique accounting combinations. For each unique accounting combination, the system should  add up  and calculate the  total amount  associated with all line items containing that combination. The system should take  Split accounting  into consideration as well. The system should then identify the accounting combination with the  highest  total amount. Based on the accounting combination with the highest total amount, the system should select the corresponding approval rule for the document. The Approval Rule matching should be selected based on our current implementation done in this ticket -    Total Amount  =  Calculated Total  ( that takes Unit Price, Quantity, Tax, Shipping and discount into consideration ) Certain Use Cases : If there is  only 1   accounting combination  with the  highest total  amount, then use this accounting combination to determine the closest Approval Rule match. If there are  2 or more  different  accounting combination  with the  same  highest total  amount, then Select the 1st accounting combination in the line item order. Check whether this line item has an Approval rule matching with it or not. If no matching rule found for the 1st accounting combination then select the next accounting combination and check the Approval matching rule against it. Example : Invoice has 5 line items. Line #2 has Split accounting. Each Accounting combination has a total amount related to its respective line item. Line Number Split Accounting Accounting Combination Total amount #1 No CC1 + Cost1 + GL1 $50 #2.1 Yes CC1 + Cost1 + GL2 $25 #2.2 Yes CC1 + Cost2 + GL2 $150 #3 No CC1 + Cost2 + GL2 $65 #4 No CC1 + Cost3 + GL1 + Customer1 $100 #5 No CC1 + Cost1 + GL1 $75 Total amount for each accounting combination added up to - CC1 + Cost1 + GL1 = $50 + $75 = $125 (Line #1 + Line #5) CC1 + Cost1 + GL2 = $25 (Line #2.1) CC1 + Cost2 + GL2  = $150 + $65 =  $215  (Selected) (Line #2.2 + Line #3) CC1 + Cost3 + GL1 + Customer1 = $100 (Line #4) Accounting Combination  CC1 + Cost2 + GL2  should be selected based on the Total amount of  $215 , that is highest amongst other accounting combinations. The system will now try to find the closest Approval rule match against this  Selected  accounting Combination. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All. Questions : Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date\",\n",

The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. UI Design for Approval Matching Technique Settings Add a new section with  title  called as - “ Approval Matching Technique ”. Add a  short description  below the title - “This setting determines the method by which approval rules are applied to documents.” Add a  sub-title  below this description - “ Choose how would you like to match approvals: ” Add  2 options  below the sub-title - “Approve based on the first line item's accounting combination.” Add  tooltip  besides Option  (a)  - “ The system assigns approval rules based on the accounting combination found in the first line item of the document, without considering other line items. ” “Approve based on the accounting combination with the highest total amount across all line items.” Add  tooltip  besides Option  (b)  - “ The system evaluates all unique accounting combinations across all line items, including individual split accounting combinations. It selects the accounting combination with the highest total amount and assigns the corresponding approval rule. ” Template : You can design something like this. It doesn’t have to be exactly this way. Please ensure that this section blends seamlessly into the Workflow page. If you have a better way of displaying the above settings, please feel free to share your suggestions. UI Implementation of Approval Matching Technique Settings Approval Matching Technique  settings should  only  be visible when the client is using the new Dynamic Approval Workflow. The system should  only  allow the Admin to select  one  option at a time. When the new Dynamic Approval Workflow is turned  ON  for the  first time  for a client, the system should select  Option (a)  by default. BE Implementation of Approval Matching Technique Settings Option (a)  - “ Approve based on the first line item's accounting combination. ” Utilize the original implementation that was developed according to the Original MVP ticket -    Option (b)  - “ Approve based on the accounting combination with the highest total amount across all line items. ” Implement the new Approval rule matching logic introduced in this ticket -    Do we need a data fix for existing customers?

       "     'description': 'Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( — ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline. Success Criteria: Effective implementation of T&Cs management and assignment system enhancements. Improved flexibility and control for Admins and Buyers in handling T&Cs.

The reason being, that in this case, we DO NOT want the user to unset these T&Cs as the unitID default. Case #2: If there are more than 1 sets of custom T&Cs in the unitID, then if the user opens up the editing modal for one that has already been set as the unitID default. Then the toggle should be in the “ On ” state, and it SHOULD be in read-only mode. If we don’t do this, the user could unset these T&Cs as the default, without a replacement unitID default.

The implementation of a background service designed to capture and log every modification to the custom T&Cs within a unitID addresses several critical needs within the organization: By systematically recording who made changes, when these changes were made, the method used for the changes (API, bulk upload, UI), and the specific nature of the changes, the organization can ensure a higher level of compliance with internal policies and external regulatory requirements. This comprehensive change log will serve as an essential tool for audits, offering a clear trail of modifications for accountability and verification purposes. Additionally, in instances of errors or disputes regarding the custom T&Cs, having a detailed history of changes can expedite resolution. By identifying when a change was made and by whom, it is easier to trace back through the decision-making process, understand the context of the modifications, and, if necessary, correct errors or address disputes more efficiently. Finally, in the future, by analyzing the change logs, the organization can identify patterns or trends in the modifications of the T&Cs, which can inform future improvements to the contract management processes, training needs for users, or enhancements to the T&Cs themselves.

When the Admin clicks on the “ Name ” of an existing set of T&Cs in the T&Cs management screen \\xa0 What should the user see the on the T&Cs editing modal? This modal should be titled “ Edit Custom Terms & Conditions “ This modal should include fields called \" Name \" and \" Description ”. Both of these fields should be populated with the relevant values stored in the DB for this set of T&Cs.  The system must support rich text editing for the T&Cs content to allow for detailed and formatted contractual language. Under the T&Cs content, this modal should also display controls to associate the T&Cs with specific suppliers or company codes. These controls should have the label “ Associate these T&Cs with: “ If this set of T&Cs had any associations stored with it, those should be pre-populated here by default. If no associations were previously stored with this set of T&Cs, then the system should display the placeholder text “ These Terms & Conditions are not currently associated to any PO attributes. Please click on the “+“ to specify any desired associations. “ There should be a clickable “ + ” button under this placeholder text. When the user clicks on this button, the placeholder text should be replaced by UI controls to allow the association of these T&Cs with PO attributes. These controls should be layed out in 2-columns, where the 1st column is titled “ Purchase Order Attribute “ and the 2nd one is titled “ Values “. The 1st column should display a single select drop-down; with the following options for now: Company Codes Supplier When a new row is added, neither of the options mentioned above should be selected by default. The 2nd column should display a multi-select type-ahead field By default, this field should be inactive, until the user makes a selection in the 1st field. There should be a “x”, or trash can button to the right of the 2nd input control. There should be a “ X ” button in the top-right corner of this modal. Clicking this should just close the modal, without modifying the state of the system. There should be 2 action buttons in the footer of this modal. The first button should be a “ Cancel ” button, which should functionally behave in an identical manner to the “ X ” button at the top of the modal. The 2nd button should be a “ Save ” button, which, when clicked will save the user’s provided information, and update the system state accordingly. \\xa0 What is the minimum/required set of data/information that a user MUST provide, when creating a set of custom T&Cs? At a minimum, the user MUST provide data in the following fields on this modal, in order for the “ Save ” button to become active and clickable: A Name for the set of custom T&Cs being created. Content for the set of custom T&Cs being created. \\xa0 What additional, optional data can the user provide , when creating a set of custom T&Cs? Optionally, the user can also provide the following information about the set of custom T&Cs being created: A Description for the set of custom T&Cs being created. The Suppliers and/or Company Codes that the set of custom T&Cs should be associated with. \\xa0 Is there any user specified information on a set of custom T&Cs that will be used as a uniqueness constraint in the T&Cs management system? The system should ensure that any set of custom T&Cs that’s being created, should be unique within the unitID. This uniqueness check should be based on the T&Cs name. If the user tries to save a set of custom T&Cs that has the same name as an existing set, then the system should not allow the user to save that set when the “ Save ” button is clicked. Instead, the user should be shown an error message under/above the “ Save ” button. This message should read “ Oops! Another set of custom T&Cs with the same name already exists. “ Should the uniqueness check be case sensitive or not? Follow whatever pattern is the standard across the system. \\xa0 How should the Company Code and/or Supplier association controls work on this modal? The first field should be a single select type ahead, and the user should only have 2 options in it;  Company Codes  and  Suppliers . If the user selects the  Company Codes  option, the 2nd field should be a multi-select type ahead. This field should show all the active company codes in the unitID. Any company codes that have already been selected in this field, should not be part of the list of options presented to the user. Each selected option should be listed in the field as a “ pill ” with a “ x ” in order to remove it as a selection. If the source data for one of these selections is deactivated, or deleted from the unitID, the next time the Admin is looking at this field, that particular selection should be highlighted orange, with a “?” in the pill. Hovering over the “?” should let the user know that this value is no longer available in the unitID. If the user selects the  Supplier  option, the 2nd field should be a multi-select type ahead. This field should show all the active suppliers in the unitID. Any suppliers that have already been selected in this field, should not be part of the list of options presented to the user.

Hovering over the “?” should let the user know that this value is no longer available in the unitID. The user should NOT be able to create more than 1 row of associations across the same PO attribute. The “ + ” button should always remain visible, allowing the user to add additional rows of associated attributes. The “ + ” button should become disabled if the user adds rows of associations for all available PO attributes. \\xa0 \\xa0 Question Answer Q asked by … Q asked on … A provided by … A provided on … Validate and approve the messages added for the following scenarios:  - When an existing set of T&Cs is successfully updated in the DB: \" Item {{ items }} has been updated. \" Change the message to “ {{ items }} has been updated successfully. ” Provide a message to display on the UI, in case there is a technical error preventing an existing set of T&Cs from being updated.

       "      'description': 'Business Case: The current system limitation only allows for the management of a single, predefined set of Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) for each unitID, restricting administrative flexibility and responsiveness to changing contractual requirements. This enhancement aims to introduce a feature enabling the creation, management, and assignment of multiple sets of custom T&Cs within each unitID. This functionality is critical for accommodating diverse and evolving contractual obligations specific to different suppliers or scenarios. By allowing for the dynamic creation of custom T&Cs, the system will empower administrators to tailor contractual language to specific needs, improving compliance, and operational efficiency. What’s wrong with the current UI?   The current UI is only meant to handle a single set of custom T&Cs for a unitID. It displays a single rich text editor, which allows the Admins to define the custom T&Cs that the unitID will use. This bakes in the assumption that there will always be just one set of T&Cs that will be used across all POs that the unitID issues to all suppliers.  What value will the updated UI bring? This new UI will be inspired by other master data creation/editing interfaces used in the application. This will enable the creation and editing of an arbitrary number of custom T&Cs that an Admin might want to maintain for the unitID.   Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: If the feature flag added in   has not been removed from the system. Then the unitID MUST have this feature flag enabled.

Use whatever pattern we’re following throughout the rest of the system.           you have mentioned rich text editor for T&Cs text. Do we need to test the entire functionality of the toolbar of rich text editor in the scope of this ticket? No, that shouldn’t be necessary.

All customers using the new Approval Workflow feature toggle. What pages should this change impact?  Company > Workflow > Approval Rules. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins. How should this change work? If there are any type of errors in the bulk upload file or processing failure, the system should show a red exclamation: Hovering on the icon should show a tooltip saying  Download Error Report . Clicking on the  Download Error Report  icon should download the error report. The system identifies the errors after processing the file : If there are invalid records in the columns of the approval rules bulk upload file, the system should mention them in the error report as per the existing standard of bulk upload error report. Please refer to the following pattern. Row# of the file. Header of the file (if missing all together) Issue(s) that causes the error. If there are multiple errors for a single row, all errors should be visible in a separate row. The Processing Failure : The system supports bulk upload file in .XLSX format. If the user tries to upload the file in a format the system does not support, there should be a processing failure report. The error report in the PDF should say “Invalid file format. Kindly download the template and use that file format for bulk upload.“ If the user removes any required column from the bulk upload file or provides an invalid column name, the system should provide those details in the PDF error report. Each error should be accommodated in a separate row in case of multiple errors. Other types of Errors that can happen : Duplicate Rule Name with different Condition(s). Two rules with same combination of Condition(s). Two rules with overarching combination of Condition(s), like one rule has catch all condition that covers rule two’s condition as well. Users without Approver role for PR, CR, and PRQ documents. Users without AP Approver role for Invoices and Memo documents. Invalid Condition(s) - Inactive or deleted accounting objects. Invalid Approver(s) - Inactive or deleted Approvers. Note: Create the Approval Rule Bulk Upload Error Report template similar to how it works for Users / Suppliers error report. Description added below was updated on 2/27/2024 to improve clarity on this ticket. - Error Message templates : Missing Header Error : “[Column Name]” column is missing. Column Name – Row_Number Applies_To Rule_Name Rule_Description Missing Data Error : Missing data in the “[Column Name]” column.

Column Names – L1_Approver L2_Approver L3_Approver Etc. Please utilize all those error messages also that we have currently implemented, on the UI, for various validation related use cases . Regarding the Error Report icon, I agree that we should retain the icon until a new Bulk upload file has been uploaded .  (NEW - 3/28/2024) When a Bulk upload file is uploaded and the system detects error(s) in the file, an Error Report should be generated. Upon opening the Error Report, the Error Report icon should  persist  on the Approval Rule page, allowing the Admin to revisit the Error Report if necessary. The Error Report icon should  disappear  if a new Bulk upload file is uploaded  without  any error(s). If a new Bulk upload file is uploaded and error(s) are  detected , the Error Report icon should  refresh  with a new Error Report. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All.

If the value in the optional field is not given at the line item, the system considers only the values in the required fields at the line item for the accounting validation. Based on that, the system decided what fields should be compared in the accounting validation with the accounting string master data. Add Line Item via Bulk Upload: The system adds the item(s) to the PR it is added via Bulk Upload. While adding an item to the PR via bulk upload: The system should not run the accounting validation if the system does not find at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  based on the existing priority logic to find and assign accounting and organization objects to the line item of the PR. In that case, when the requester opens(loads) the PR, the system should show the missing fields error message according to the document-level field configuration. The system should run the accounting validation if it does find values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  based on the existing priority logic to find and assign accounting and organization objects to the line item of the PR. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system should save the state in the DB. If the system finds the accounting string errors, it should save them in the DB. The system should show the error message box above the line item grid. The system should run the accounting validation if it does find values in all the required and optional fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  based on the existing priority logic to find and assign accounting and organization objects to the line item of the PR. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system should save the state in the DB. If the system finds the accounting string errors, it should save them in the DB. The system should show the error message box above the line item grid. In case some line items in bulk upload file have values in all the required and optional fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  based on the existing priority logic to find and assign accounting and organization objects to the line item of the PR and some line items have not values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service , the system should run the accounting validation for the items having values in all the required and optional fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service . For line items with values in all the required and optional fields: If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system should save the state in the DB. If the system finds the accounting string errors, it should save them in the DB. The system should show the error message box above the line item grid. User with Coding Restrictions: The system should ignore the values of accounting and organization objects from the bulk upload file if a user with coding restrictions tries to add the line item to PR via bulk upload with accounting and organization objects given in it. ( Existing Implementation )  The system should look into the user profile to get the values of the accounting and organization objects. ( Existing Implementation )  The system should not run the accounting validation if the system does not find at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  from the user profile. In that case, when the requester opens(loads) the PR, the system should show the missing fields error message according to the document-level field configuration. The system should run the accounting validation if it does find values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  from the user profile. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system should save the state in the DB. If the system finds the accounting string errors, it should save them in the DB. The system should show the error message box above the line item grid. The system should run the accounting validation if it does find values in all the required and optional fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  from the user profile. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system should save the state in the DB. If the system finds the accounting string errors, it should save them in the DB. The system should show the error message box above the line item grid.\",\n",

       "      'description': 'User Story: As an Admin , I want to use additional parameters to route my documents for approval  so that  we can ensure a 100% compliance with our business process and attain efficiency through the workflow automation. Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system supports the inclusion of additional Organization and Accounting fields in the workflow rules definition. 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true  and  the new workflow rules feature toggle = true. Important Notes:   The new workflow enhancements will only be enabled for Maersk and Forest Lawn initially. For all other customers for whom this will be turned off, the existing functionality will prevail (for both Vroozi Invoice and Purchase). 3.  What pages should this change impact?  The Company → Workflow page. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. Admin creates a new rule or updates an existing rule: When they add a new field under Condition(s)  or  click on an existing field’s drop down, they are able to select any of the following new fields presented in the drop down: Note:  The Admin is able to select any of the below fields as the first condition. The system displays the  custom labels  of the below fields in the drop down if they’ve been configured by the Admin. WBS Element,  if activated. Internal Order,  if activated. Profit Center,  if activated. Class,  if activated. Customer,  if activated. Purchasing organizations. Special Case (See below for more details) : Location Type,  if activated. Value :  The Admin is able to filter any  undeleted  and  active  values of the selected field. How NEW accounting elements should work  - All 4 Accounting Categories ( Cost Centers ,  WBS Elements ,  Internal Orders  and  Profit Centers ) should be available when a new Rule is created. Admin can  only  choose 1 Accounting Category in an Approval Rule, at a time. The other 3 Accounting Categories should become hidden so that the  Admin  cannot select these categories in the Field section later. Location Type   should be a field that can only be selected if - Location Type selected in the Approval Rule belongs to a Company Code that satisfies the below condition. Company Code has Location Type required = Yes. Classes  - Can be linked to Single, Multiple or All Company Codes. Purchasing Organizations  - Can be linked to Single or All Company Codes. Customers  - How is the Customer field field filtered on all documents? Lets keep the dependencies between the Customer and Company Code. GL Account and other Accounting Categories should be available based on the Company Code selected for this approval rule. Customer Data used by current clients in Production ( for reference ) - Client Company Code Accounting Categories GL Account Maersk Yes Yes Gradient Yes Delta Fuel Yes Ednovate Yes Custom Goods Yes Yes (sometimes individually) Yes (sometimes individually) ICE Yes USJ Yes Yes NBCU Yes Yes BAA Yes Search Filtering : Admin should be able to search for the new Accounting elements in the Search filter section. Narrow search by: WBS Element,  if activated. Internal Order,  if activated. Profit Center,  if activated. Class,  if activated. Customer,  if activated. Location Type,  if activated. Purchasing organizations. Workflow Rule matching : The system should consider  new  Accounting elements while matching documents ( such as Invoices, Memos, & Payment Requests ) . Please refer to this ticket for existing matching rule implementation that we are looking to develop in the Mini-Release (RC-2024-2.1.0) -   6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes, as new fields are being added to the workflow rules. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Potentially no. But existing workflow rules will be impacted as a result of AC #6. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date 1 5 Deepak October 20, 2023  /    # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 How is the Customer field field filtered on all documents? 2 When should we implement the BE validation logic to disallow more than one Accounting Categories  suggests to implement it as part of upload ticket      I would implement it as part of this ticket, so we already have the error, and re-use it in the bulk upload (Jimena) Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Should we support Purchasing Organizations? 2 Should we support Location Type? 3 Should we use the Default Class field in Location to filter Classes?

implement accordingly: Acceptance Criteria: A new feature toggle named ‘ INTELLIGENCE__INVOICE_EXCEPTION_HANDLER ’ should be added to allow for this feature to be TURN ON/OFF at company level. If this feature is enabled, a new settings should be available in Accounts Payable > Settings > Preferences section, where admin can enable/disable this options for their company. Rename current ML settings to  Apply Machine Learning to invoice line-items   for coding New settings will be called Apply Machine Learning to invoice for exception handler If this new settings is disabled, there should be no changes to the current flow and no model endpoint should be called for prediction. If this new settings is enabled, During invoice processing, when there is an exception, the system should be able to make a call to model endpoint with provided mapping details and display appropriate resolution with confidence score to the user. AP Processor User should see new button as shown in the mock below to see the suggested exception resolution per line that has non-GR related exceptions which should be shown as follow. Clicking on the Suggest Resolution(s) button  should get the resolutions for non-GR related exceptions from Model Endpoint and display resolutions to AP Processor with confidence score.  AP Processor User should be able to see the confidence score by clicking on the bulb icon as shown below. Note: For the lightbulb icons, we will follow the current color scheme that we already use for Vroozi Intelligence: Blue - resolutions with >= 90% confidence Orange - resolutions with < 90% confidence However, if AP processor decides to submit the exceptions for manual exception handling by clicking on the Submit For Exception Handling button, the invoice should be moved to Exception state and Suggest Resolution(s) button should not longer be available for AP processor to avoid conflict in resolutions from AI/Manual process. After the Model suggested resolutions, AP processor should be able to either Accept or Reject resolutions by clicking on Reject/Accept button after the resolution has been provided. The confirmation dialog should be shown when user clicks on the Accept  button as it is today. The exceptions should be resolved after user clicks on Yes, Accept button and invoice should be moved to next step for Approval, whereas canceling should make no changes. If AP Processor User is not happy with the model suggested resolutions, he should be able to reject the resolution by clicking on Reject button before submitting it for manual exception handler. Upon rejecting, the invoice should be moved back to DRAFT and Submit For Exception Handling button should be available again. After rejection, AP processor should be able to see the Suggest Resolution(s) button again, along with Submit For Exceptin handling button and decide to either submit for manually exception handling or make modification to invoices and re-generate model suggested resolutions by clicking on Suggest Resolution button.  When invoice is submitted for manual exception handler, the exception handler should also be able to see the Suggest Resolution(s) button along with Bulb Icon showing all the model suggested resolutions with confidence for each exceptions. Clicking on the Suggest Resolution(s) button should then apply the top resolutions for each exception and a new Clear Resolution(s) button should appear. AP Exception Handler User should be able to clear suggested AI resolutions by clicking on Clear Resolution buttons. Exception Handler should be able to submit exception resolutions back to the AP Processor as it is today after resolutions is selected. Once the resolution is provided by Exception Handler, AP Processor should be able to Accept or Reject the resolutions (existing functionality) Scenarios   Note:  All the above flow should be applicable for all types of PO based invoices that contains non-GR exception including cXML invoices as well as auto invoice processing flow.',\n",

Acceptance Criteria:  If an approver is logged in and the admin deactivates or deletes the logged-in approver’s account in the meantime, the system should immediately log out the approver as soon as they take any action. This should be implemented for the following approvers Sourcing Financial Budget Initially it was created as a bug for the budget approver. after investigation, it turned out that this is a gap that persists from the beginning for all the approvers. Therefore, we converted it into a story. For the original bug, below are the steps to reproduce. Steps to Reproduce: Login as budget approver on Devqa-2 Login as admin , go to User Management Inactive the budget approver  Create the budget from the budget approver Actual Result: Budget is created successfully Expected Result: User should be instantly logout when user is Inactive Screen-shot:',\n",

When a Financial Approver open a PR/CR document and click Approve button: Existing Implementation: When Financial Approver clicks the Approve button on PR/CR document, “Add Approval Notes” modal is displayed. User adds (optional) note and clicks Approve button, “Add Approval Notes” modal is closed and Approve button changes its label to “Validating Data”. Once the accounting validation is successful, the user is redirected to “Approve Purchase Requests” grid.

This occurs for invoices that are created by the system, such as through cXML or OCR.

Ideally, the resolution should enable the control to fully utilize the width of the container when necessary, but refrain from doing so when the text is short.

The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( — ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline. Success Criteria: Effective implementation of T&Cs management and assignment system enhancements. Improved flexibility and control for Admins and Buyers in handling T&Cs. Seamless integration with existing systems and processes. Positive feedback from primary stakeholders, Yukon and Maersk. Milestones: MVP - Minimum Viable Product: Product manager to validate assumptions and solution design with stakeholders. Engineering to complete    MUP - Minimum Useable Product:                                     Purchase Order: Allow Buyers to create and associate Ad-hoc T&Cs to a specific PO Purchase Order: Print the correct T&Cs on the PO PDF Vroozi Admin: Allow Admins to specify whether PO T&Cs can be updated via the POCR function POCR: Allow only the “PO Owner” to update T&Cs via POCR POCR: Record and display T&Cs changes done on a PO, in the PO Document Change History Integration team  → SPIKE: Integration team needs to investigate impact on NBCU, if T&Cs can be updated vai POCR Payables team  → Supplier Portal: Display PO T&Cs in the Vroozi Supplier Portal Payables team  → Supplier Portal: Ensure SP users are able to Confirm / Dispute T&Cs changes on a PO updated via POCR MLP - Minimum Lovable Product: Vroozi Admin: Figure out how to introduce an “Apply to All” option for associations SPIKE: Investigate how we can compute, store and display a fine grained “Diff” for the T&Cs content, when updated by an Admin         Integration team  →     POCR: Allow Admins to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Allow Central Reciever to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Ensure that T&Cs updates on POs; done via POCR, are reviewed and approved by the “PO Owner” Vroozi PMAN: Allow Buyers, Admins, Central Receivers to create custom T&Cs and save them in their user profile for reuse at a later date Vroozi PMAN: Allow users to view and manage their custom T&Cs from their “My Data” screen \\xa0 The wireframes for this project can also be found here:',\n",

       "      'description': \"Business Case: The functionality being built under   will allow company administrators to create and manage multiple sets of Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) that can be associated with Purchase Orders (POs) based on specific parameters (Company Code and Supplier). To streamline operations and ensure that every PO is sent out with the correct set of T&Cs without manual intervention, we need to enable the system to automatically assign the appropriate T&Cs to POs when they are manually generated by an Admin or Buyer. This enhancement is crucial for maintaining compliance, ensuring that all transactions are governed by the correct legal frameworks, and enhancing user satisfaction by automating a critical aspect of the procurement process. We will also need t oupdate how assigned T&Cs are displayed on the DRAFT PO, in order to improve the UX.  Acceptance Criteria: Pre-requisites: The feature flag defined in   must be enabled for the unitID. The unitID should be configured to use the “Custom Terms & Conditions” option on the  Admin Panel → Documents → Purchase Orders  screen.

PMAN Admin ( when creating a PO ) PMAN Buyer Data-Fix Necessity Will there be any requirement for data migration or transformation as part of this change? TBD … If required, please provide details of what the expected effect of this data fix will be: TBD … \\xa0 What triggers the association of T&Cs with a PO? An Admin or a Buyer manually creating a PO via either the “Create PO” wizard, or the “Ready for Sourcing” screen. The T&C assignment should happen once the DRAFT PO has been generated by the system, but before the user lands on the DRAFT PO screen. \\xa0 How does the system determine which set of T&Cs to assign to a PO? By checking if the PO's Company Code and Supplier match those associated with a set of active T&Cs. The system should first try and fetch active T&Cs that have specified associations, that are an exact match for the Company Code + Supplier combination on the PO document. if no such T&Cs are found, then the system should try and fetch T&Cs that only have either Company Codes, or Suppliers specified in their associations, and the POs Company Code or Supplier match with those specified associations on the T&Cs. If a matching set of T&Cs is found: The system assigns this set of T&Cs to the PO. If multiple matching sets of T&Cs are found: The system assigns the first set from this list of T&Cs, to the PO. If no specific match is found: The system assigns the default set of T&Cs to the PO. In the case of the default T&Cs having specific Company Code and Supplier associations: The system treats the default T&Cs as universally applicable, ignoring any specific associations. \\xa0 What should the system do if there is only one set of T&Cs in the system without specific associations? The system automatically assigns this universal set of T&Cs to the PO. QA needs to test this with the Ad-hoc output flows. The PO document needs to store which T&Cs have been applied to it. Because we have to display them on the UI. So the PO needs to show whatever the state of the T&Cs was when the PO was sent to the vendor. \\xa0 How should the auto-assigned T&Cs be displayed on a DRAFT PO? The system should continue showing the assigned T&Cs on the DRAFT PO, exactly where they’re displayed today. Towards the bottom of the document, above the action buttons.  The T&Cs section should ONLY be visible if there are T&Cs assigned to the PO.  The height of the T&Cs section should be capped, to be the same as the adjacent “Notes to Supplier” section.  The T&Cs section should be titled “Terms & Conditions” This section should display the unique name of the assigned T&Cs  This section should display the content of the assigned T&Cs If the content doesn’t fit into the fixed height of this section, it should be truncated and the body of text should end with an ellipsis ( … ), so the user understands that there is more content.  \\xa0 When should the system display a “Show more …” link in the T&Cs section? If the T&Cs section is showing truncated content, then there should be a “Show more …” link below the body of text.  Whether or not this link is visible, should NOT affect the total height of the T&Cs section.  This link should be clickable by the user.  \\xa0 What should the user see when they click on the “Show more …” link? When the user clicks on the “Show more …” link, the system should display a modal to the user.  The document behind the modal should appear in a dimmed state; as is standard across the application. This modal should have the tile “Terms & Conditions“ This modal should display the unique name of the assigned T&Cs  This modal should display the optional description of the assigned T&Cs If there is no description provided for the assigned T&Cs, then the description field should NOT be visible on the UI.

       "      'description': 'Business Case: Maintaining an accurate and comprehensive record of changes made to the “ unitID default ” status of custom Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) is crucial. The implementation of a background service designed to capture and log every modification to the custom T&Cs within a unitID was completed in  . This ticket builds on top of that, and adds the ability to track when the unitID default T&Cs are changed: By systematically recording who made change, when this change was made, the method used for the changes (API, bulk upload, UI), the organization can ensure a higher level of compliance with internal policies and external regulatory requirements. This comprehensive change log will serve as an essential tool for audits, offering a clear trail of modifications for accountability and verification purposes. Additionally, in instances of errors or disputes regarding the custom T&Cs, having a detailed history of this change can expedite resolution. By identifying when such a change was made and by whom, it is easier to trace back through the decision-making process, understand the context of the modifications, and, if necessary, correct an error or address a dispute more efficiently. Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: If the feature flag added in   has not been removed from the system. Then the unitID MUST have this feature flag enabled. The data table defined in   must have already been developed, so that any custom T&Cs that are created, can be displayed in it. The T&Cs creation function defined in   must have already been developed, so that at the very least the creation event can be recorded. The T&Cs editing functionality defined in   must have already been developed, so that at the very least the edit event can be recorded. The ability to set T&Cs as the unitID default; as defined in  must have already been developed, so that any change in this status can be recorded.  \\xa0 \\xa0 Impacted Vroozi Roles Which user roles within the Vroozi Admin system will be affected by this change?

To streamline operations and ensure that every PO is sent out with the correct set of T&Cs without manual intervention, we need to enable the system to automatically assign the appropriate T&Cs to POs during their auto-generation process. This enhancement is crucial for maintaining compliance, ensuring that all transactions are governed by the correct legal frameworks, and enhancing user satisfaction by automating a critical aspect of the procurement process. Acceptance Criteria: Pre-requisites: The feature flag defined in   must be enabled for the unitID. The unitID should be configured to use the “Custom Terms & Conditions” option on the  Admin Panel → Documents → Purchase Orders  screen.  The system should already allow creation and management of multiple T&Cs, as well as allowing a default set of T&Cs to be designated for the unitID.\\xa0As defined in:          Impacted Vroozi Roles Which user roles within the Vroozi Admin system will be affected by this change? PMAN Admin ( when creating and submitting a PR ) PMAN Employee Data-Fix Necessity Will there be any requirement for data migration or transformation as part of this change? TBD … If required, please provide details of what the expected effect of this data fix will be: TBD … What triggers the association of T&Cs with a PO? The system's auto-generation of a PO upon approval of a purchase request. How does the system determine which set of T&Cs to assign to a PO? By checking if the PO's Company Code and Supplier match those associated with a set of active T&Cs. The system should first try and fetch active T&Cs that have specified associations, that are an exact match for the Company Code + Supplier combination on the PO document.  if no such T&Cs are found, then the system should try and fetch T&Cs that only have either Company Codes, or Suppliers specified in their associations, and the POs Company Code or Supplier match with those specified associations on the T&Cs.  If a matching set of T&Cs is found: The system assigns this set of T&Cs to the PO. If multiple matching sets of T&Cs are found: The system assigns the first set from this list of T&Cs, to the PO. If no specific match is found: The system assigns the default set of T&Cs to the PO. In the case of the default T&Cs having specific Company Code and Supplier associations: The system treats the default T&Cs as universally applicable, ignoring any specific associations. What should the system do if there is only one set of T&Cs in the system without specific associations? The system automatically assigns this universal set of T&Cs to the PO. QA needs to test this with the Ad-hoc output flows.  The PO document needs to store which T&Cs have been applied to it. Because we have to display them on the UI. So the PO needs to show whatever the state of the T&Cs was when the PO was sent to the vendor.  When returning multiple T&Cs from the BE, the system should sort the returned results based on creation date in ASC order.  \\xa0 Question Answer Q asked by … Q asked on … A provided by … A provided on …\",\n",

( Existing implementation ) If the user updates the document without clicking the  View Error(s)  button, the system should change the label of the button from  View Error(s)  to  Submit .  The Requester can do the following actions based on the permission. Change in Header level fields. Change in Header level custom fields. Update existing line items. (from all avenues) Add new line items(from all avenues) Add notes/supplier notes Highlight the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box: Once the system scrolls the user to the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box above the Line Item grid after the  View Error(s)  button is clicked, the borders of the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box should be highlighted. The highlighted border should fade away gradually. Silkscreen on the Line Item grid (PR/CR on Load): When the system loads the PR/CR and accounting validation is in progress, the system should display the silkscreen covering the line item grid. On the silkscreen, there should be a text  Validating Data  visible. An  In Progress  Icon should be visible after the text  Validating Data.

The system should check the following factors to decide which accounting objects should be visible in the Accounting Validation Error message on the documents: The accounting/organization object is turned ON for the unitID. (Not required at this time)(Updated on )  The accounting/organization object is specified in the Accounting Configuration service. If the above two conditions are met, the system should show the accounting/organization objects and their values accordingly in the Accounting Validation Error message. If both or any of the conditions mentioned in point#1 are not met, the system should not show that accounting/organization objects in the Accounting Validation Error message',\n",

Acceptance Criteria: General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Creation: Currently, the system requires the definition of the required and optional Accounting/Organization objects in the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service . If the value in the optional field is given at the line item, the system considers it for the accounting validation in addition to the required fields. If the value in the optional field is not given at the line item, the system considers only the values in the required fields at the line item for the accounting validation. Based on that, the system decided what fields should be compared in the accounting validation with the accounting string master data. Accounting Validation at Line Item: The system should run the accounting validation as soon as it finds values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  on the line item modal. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system green message. The message should disappear in 3 seconds. If the system finds the accounting string errors, the system should show the following message This message should persist until the user resolves the issue.

The following is the pattern of the error message that should be followed: Accounting String Error - split #…  → Display all splits of the item containing that Accounting String The following Accounting String has been deactivated  → Error Code 02 The following Accounting String is not valid (does not exist)  → Error Code 01 Company Code = <Code> - <Description> Plant Code = <Code> - <Description> Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order = <Code> - <Description> GL Account = <Code> - <Description> … (display the rest of the elements in the same order the line items in separate lines) The message should read “Accounting String Error - split # (comma separated).“. The message should read “Accounting String Error - split # (- separated).“ in case of splits in the sequence has the same accounting string error. The message should tell the user why the selected accounting string combination of the mentioned line items was marked invalid. Either the string was deactivated. Or the string does not exist in Vroozi Master Data. The message should display the associated accounting combination with the mentioned splits in the strings. Please review the error message that appears on the documents above the line item grid. The success and error messages should appear just above the  Save  and  Cancel  buttons. ( added on 2024-03-22 ) The system should keep the  Save  Item button disabled until the accounting validation error message persists. Please note that the R&D done so far does not show any instance in which a certain accounting object is required in the accounting configuration service and is optional on the line item modal.  So making this the basis for our assumption, we can say that the above scenario can happen technically but not practically. QA can run such scenarios in their testing activity.  In editing the line item, the system should only run the accounting validation if the user changes the fields required for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service. The system should show the green message when no errors are found. The system should show the error message if invalid accounting strings are identified. If the line item already has the invalid accounting string, then opening its line item modal should show the accounting validation error message on it.

When a Sourcing Approver open a PR/CR document and click Approve button: Existing Implementation: When Sourcing Approver clicks the Approve button on PR/CR document, “Approval Decision Code” modal is displayed.  User selects the decision code and clicks Submit button, “Approval Decision Code” modal is closed and Approve button changes its label to “Validating Data”. Once the accounting validation is successful, the user is redirected to “Approve Purchase Requests” grid. Alternate flow if the accounting validation fails, “View Error” label is displayed on the Approve button. On clicking “View Error” button, screen focus moves to top of the line item grid where errors are displayed. General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Approval: Currently, the system is executing accounting validation after Sourcing Approver selects approval decision. After this change, the system will run accounting validation before the “Approval Decision Code” modal is displayed.  Dynamic Approve button labels: Once the user clicks the  Approve  button on the PR/CR, the  Approve  button label should change to  Validating Data . Once the user clicks the  Approve  button, all other action buttons and fields on the PR/CR should become disabled.

If user reloads the document in  Validating Data  state, and If the accounting validation is still in progress after the refresh or reload, The system should take the user to the  Validating Data  button. The system should navigate the user to the screen accordingly if the Accounting Validation is completed successfully. ( Existing implementation ) The system should change the button’s label from  Validating Data  to  View Error(s)  if the Accounting Validation is completed and error(s) are identified. Clicking on the  View Error(s)  button should scroll the user to the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box above the Line Item grid. Once the user clicks the  View Error(s)  button, the system should revert the label to  Approve . The  Approve  button should remain disabled until all the accounting Validation errors are resolved. ( Existing implementation ) If the user updates the document without clicking the  View Error(s)  button, the system should change the label of the button from  View Error(s)  to  Approve .  The Sourcing approver can do the following actions based on the permission. Change in Header level fields. Change in Header level custom fields. Update existing line items. (from all avenues) Add new line items(from all avenues) Add notes/supplier notes Highlight the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box: Once the system scrolls the user to the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box above the Line Item grid after the  View Error(s)  button is clicked, the borders of the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box should be highlighted. The highlighted border should fade away gradually. Silkscreen on the Line Item grid (PR/CR on Load): When the system loads the PR/CR and accounting validation is in progress, the system should display the silkscreen covering the line item grid. On the silkscreen, there should be a text  Validating Data  visible. An  In Progress  Icon should be visible after the text  Validating Data. The silkscreen should prevent the user from clicking anything from the line item grid. The system should disable all the action button(s) on the PR/CR while the accounting validation process is in progress. The user should be able to edit all the header-level fields and custom fields that do not directly impact the line items.

Queue Name: int-vroozi-api-invoice-incoming-queue  int-vroozi-api-transactional-documents  +----------------------------+\\n| vroozi_api_async_requests  |\\n+----------------------------+\\n| - id: String               |\\n| - trackingId: String       |\\n| - docType: Enum            |\\n| - processingResult: Object |\\n| - status: Enum             |\\n| - lastUpdated: Date        |\\n| - dateCreated: Date        |\\n| - requestPath: String.     |\\n| - requestMethod: String    |\\n+----------------------------+\\n\\n+-----------------+\\n| ProcessingResult  |\\n+-----------------+\\n| - metadata: Object    |\\n| - status: Enum    |\\n| - errors: Array    |\\n| - warnings: Array |\\n+-----------------+\\n\\n+-----------------+\\n| Metadata        |\\n+-----------------+\\n| - payloadRef: Object    |\\n| - vendorInvoiceNumber: String    |\\n| - externalId: String    |\\n| - invoiceNumber: String |\\n+-----------------+ 4- We will store the incoming payload to S3 in .json file, use the bucket name: vroozi-test-file-storage. File name should be generated uniquely (id), and might have unitId in the prefix, it could have vendor invoice Number as well if provided, and append timestamp to make this unique. Store the references of this file into the collection. 5-  docType can be used to determine the transactional document type, e.g InvoiceModel etc. 6- SQS Queue : Create a transactional document processing queue. Stores incoming document for asynchronous processing. Start with Invoice Processing Queue. (We can use one queue for all documents vs separate queue for each document).  Queue message {\\n    \"transmissionId\": \"ac395c84-55f8-434a-80e2-abb2952e572b\",\\n    \"type\": \"JSON\",  // XML, JSON, STRING, RAW_DATA, FILE, PLAIN_TEXT, CXML;\\n    \"unitId\": \"2\"\\n} 7- Return Async Response to Client : Once the incoming document is stored and file is uploaded to S3,  and transmission is send on SQS, we can return the response to client. Return the Async response {\\n  \"trackingId\": \"98fea22e-1537-4b6c-b445-eda852132c6f\",\\n  \"status\": \"PROCESSING\",\\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-25T15:10:11.104+0000\"\\n} 8- Expose the GET tracking by Id api, end point: v1/async-requests/{trakcingId} Response: {\\n    \"id\": \"661d3819a5d9472e2266ecf0\",\\n    \"trackingId\": \"ac395c84-55f8-434a-80e2-abb2952e572b\",\\n    \"docType\": \"InvoiceModel\",\\n    \"processingResult\": {\\n        \"metadata\": {\\n          \"payloadRef\": {\\n                 \"id\":\"123213123212\", // S3 attachment Id\\n                 \"label\" : \"Name of the file\",\\n                 \"type\" : \"AttachmentModel\",\\n                 \"archived\" : false\\n              },\\n            \"vendorInvoiceNumber\" : \"\",\\n            \"externalId\" : \"\",\\n            \"invoiceNumber\" : \"\", // what else we could have as unique identifier\\n        }         \\n        \"status\": PROCESSING,\\n        \"errors\": [],\\n        \"warnings\": []\\n    },\\n    \"status\": \"PROCESSING\", // IN_PROGRESS\\n    \"dateCreated\": \"2024-04-15T14:22:17.270+0000\",\\n    \"lastUpdated\": \"2024-04-15T14:22:17.270+0000\",\\n    \"requestPath\": \"/api/invoices/incoming/async\",\\n    \"requestMethod\": \"POST\"\\n} 9- Preprocessing validation should return the response back to the client. If the payload is valid and accepted for processing, than we need to perform all post validations, e.g resource lookups, data integrity etc. 10- If we have any any error in the payload processing, we will give Internal Server error and will not store the transmission 11- When there is invalid Invoice payload (missing required fields or invalid enum values), we give the validation error. Required fields are: (invalid json), vendorInvoiceNumber',\n",

       "      'description': 'Log injection occurs when an application fails to sanitize untrusted data used for logging. An attacker can forge log content to prevent an organization from being able to trace back malicious activities. What is the potential impact? If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded can be compromised. This frequently occurs because attackers can inject the log entry separator of the logger framework, commonly newlines, and thus insert artificial log entries. Other attacks could also occur requiring only field pollution, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection (for example, Log4Shell) if the logged data is fed to other application components, which may interpret the injected data differently. The focus of this rule is newline character replacement. Log Forge An attacker, able to create independent log entries by injecting log entry separators, inserts bogus data into a log file to conceal his malicious activities. This obscures the content for an incident response team to trace the origin of the breach as the indicators of compromise (IoCs) lead to fake application events. The following code is vulnerable to log injection as it constructs log entries using untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this to manipulate the chain of events being recorded.

Companies now have greater control to ensure budgets are\\nenforced for all spend under management.\\n\\n**[Image here]**\\n\\nFor the Alternate Approve, both approvers (approver and alternate) will get a notification to approve a document.  Either approver can take action on that document.  \\nSimilarly for the Alternate Buyer, the buyer and alternate will have the option to take action on the work item.\\n\\nNow Admins can assign alternate users to enhance the management of approval and purchasing workflows for faster and more flexible workflows.\\n\\n## Type Ahead Search to Assign Approvers\\nto assign an approver (eg: alternate, out of office, next approver) Vroozi introduces a user-friendly search field to quickly find and select an approver.\\nInstead of scrolling through dropdowns, Admins can now use type ahead search to assign a person.\\n\\n**[Image here]**\\n\\n## Accounting Validation Enhancements\\n\\nWith Accounting Validation enabled, companies can make sure that valid accounting combinations are used in the purchasing documents.  In this release, the Vroozi team delivered new features to enhance the validation and user experience. \\nPlease note that Accounting Validation needs to be enabled for your account.\\n\\n### Accounting Validation Display on the Line Item View\\nThe line item view now displays the results of the accounting validation so that users can take the specific actions to resolve the error(s). \\nAs the user is working in the line item view, the system will inform users immediately regarding any invalid accounting strings.  \\n**[Image here]**\\n\\n### Provide missing Output Destination when the Accounting Validation is Successful\\nWhen the Output destination is missing from the Supplier record and the system needs to prompt the user for the next step, the system will only prompt the user when the accounting validation is successful.  \\n\\n### Add Approval Notes after the Accounting Validation is Successful\\nVroozi will run the accounting validation upon the approval of the Purchase Request and will only ask the approver to add approval notes if the accounting validation is successful. In case of an invalid accounting string, \\nthe system will only display the error for the accounting validation error and will not show the Add Approval Notes prompt.\\n\\n# Resolutions\\n- Resolved an issue where the catalog item details page would get stuck loading due to a missing supplier logo.\\n- The system now properly searches documents based on Company Code.\\n- Drag-and-drop file attachment functionality now works as expected, allowing users to attach files seamlessly.\\n- The PO closing notification email has been re-translated into Japanese.\\n- When invoices with 0 tax are created from PR/POs using OCR, the tax value on the invoice accurately reflects zero tax.\\n- Tax amounts will now recalculate upon adding or updating tax codes in Apply to All.\\n- For partial invoices, we adjusted the tolerance percentage calculation method to consider the entire invoiced quantity rather than just the remaining amount.\\n- cXML, Supplier Portal, and Hopper invoices will only be displayed to relevant users in the Document Flow.\\n- The system will no longer revert to a limited line item view after updating an invoice line item .  The system will continue to \"Show all\" if that’s where the user started.\\n- \"Apply to All\" on non-PO Invoices will no longer trigger an error when there’s a missing company code.\\n- AP users can search for invoice line items regardless of letter case.\\n- OCR icons will now be displayed correctly for all relevant fields ie: where the system entered data.\\n- Requesters with Admin roles will only see  Accept/Reject after exception resolution  on  system-generated invoices (e.g., cXML or OCR) based on structured document rules matches, or defaults to the AP Processor/Manager group if no matches are found.\\n- The system will now release the budget amount upon PO cancellation.\\n- The supplier acknowledgment button will now be visible in the POCR Confirmation email in all cases where this has been enabled for a supplier.\\n- We fixed how categories are sorted on the PR/PO line item view. The list of categories will now follow the same sorting order as Category Management in the Admin panel.\\n- We did a re-translation in Japanese for the labels used on the Save & Confirm action buttons during Goods Receipt (GR) creation.\\n- Customers with a company code restriction in their user profile will now be able to use  the PR bulk upload without errors.'},\n",

This person can then potentially approve their own PR, thereby committing financial fraud.  Example scenario: The user (John Doe) has both Employee and Approver roles.  The user has a $10,000 spend limit, and a $100,000 Approval limit.  The user submits a PR for $60,000 The Approval Chain looks like  Approver 1 ($50,000) -> John Doe ($100,000) -> Approver 3 ($500,000) Currently, after the first approver's sign off, John Doe is assigned as the designated Approver on his own PR, as the system isn't built to detect this conflict. So John Doe ends up approving his own PR.  We need to solve this by ensuring that the PR skips John Doe in this case, and goes to Approver 3 instead for the next approval. Note:  The scope of the ticket is limited to the current Go Live Blocker of C&W. We just need to Fix this on the PR and CR document when the document is submitted. On the PR; the requester (Employee / Admin), and on the POCR; the person creating the CR (Employee / Admin / Buyer / Central Receiver) should be skipped from the Approval Chain. Sourcing, Budget Approval step will not require any change.\",\n",

Acceptance Criteria: If the admin attempts to update or add any information to the budget definition main screen while there is an accounting string associated with it that contains a deactivated, non-existent, deleted accounting/organization object, or the Object itself was turned Off, the system should prevent the admin from proceeding. For example, If the admin tries to update the budget amount, change the budget duration, add a new accounting string, or change the system’s behavior when the budget is averaged. When the user clicks the  SAVE  button to update the budget with an invalid accounting string, the system should display a red Noty message from the left side of the screen. The red Noty message should read: \"This budget cannot be updated because the associated accounting string contains an invalid accounting/organization object(s). Please update the budget after replacing the invalid accounting/organization object.\"  The Noty message should be a slider. It should stay on the screen for 3 to 5 seconds and then slide away. If the user hovers over the Noty message, it should remain visible as long as the user continues to hover over it. There should be an X icon on the top right corner of the Noty message. Clicking on that should disappear the Noty message. Once the admin updates the accounting string with valid objects, the system should allow the user to proceed with updating the budget.',\n",

If some information has been provided on the  Associate Accounting String  screen, the system should display the yellow message and buttons as shown in the mockup. Clicking  Save changes & go back  should associate the accounting string with the budget and navigate the user to the main budget definition screen. (i.e. the  Associate Accounting String  screen should slide away to the right and from the left, the main budget definition screen should appear.) Clicking  Go back without saving changes  should not associate the accounting string with the budget and navigate the user to the main budget definition screen.\\xa0 In the case of editing the existing accounting screen, clicking the  Go back without saving changes  button should not associate the updated accounting string with the budget. The system should keep the older version of the accounting string. In case of a duplicate Accounting String being associated with the Budgets, the system should show a noty message.\\xa0 Currently, the noty message appears when the user adds a duplicate string on the Create/Edit Budget modal. Now, the system should display that same noty message when the user tries to add a duplicate string by clicking the  Save  button from the Associate Accounting String modal. Any change in the accounting string on the  Associate Accounting String  modal should be captured in the Budget Audit Trail.

Acceptance Criteria: What is the change?  The system uses the settings in Documents → Settings → All Documents to dictate if Location should be optional, or required on AP documents. Which customers should this change impact? All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true, and All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, and All customers who have PAYMENT_REQUEST = true What pages should this change impact?  The invoice, memo and  payment request  pages. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to edit an AP document, namely: The document owner (AP Processor/Manager), Admin, Assignee, e.g. an AP Coder, an Exception Handler, an Approver, and Any AP Manager. Payment Requester How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites: Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Admin has selected one of the following against the Location field in the Documents → Settings → All Documents page. The behavior described below comes into play in the following situations, that is, in any editable state of an AP document: Document is in  ,  , or  Document being edited in   or   statuses. Document being edited while it is pending approval. Document being edited after it is approved, in   or   statuses. Document being edited after it is posted, in   status or greater. Feature toggle -   is ON. Location = REQUIRED Note:  The Location field mimics the exact behavior of the  GL Account  field, as described below. In any editable state (in any status), a user is able to save a line item without specifying a value in the Location field. The system instantly showcases a  “Line Item #n: Field ‘Location’ missing”  error message, as soon as the user saves the line item. Draft, Parked, or Rejected: When the system showcases the error listed above, the user is unable to process the document further, that is, they’re only able to see the following actions/transitions: Park, Assign, and Coding. Pending: When the system showcases the error listed above, the user is unable to Approve the document; they’re only able to Reject it. Coding and Exception Handling: When the system showcases the error listed above, the user is able to return the document back to AP. Approved, Ready to Post, Posted, and greater TBD Location = OPTIONAL The systems exhibits the current behavior. Location = HIDDEN  ( ) The system does  not  showcase the Location field in the line item section.  Location = NONE SELECTED The system implements the Location = OPTIONAL, as the default behavior. This can happen if the client is not using the PURCHASE__COMPANY_ACCOUNTING_LINE_ITEM_CONFIGURATION feature toggle. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Potentially no. Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes, invoices and memos that are currently in the early stages of the invoice process, e.g.   or   status. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 What happens when a document is edited after it is approved and the accounting is updated? Does the system push the document back to Draft? \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 2 What other implications are there of making the Location field required or hidden? \\xa0 The error messages may not support custom labels, which we would need to handle for Required cases. \\xa0 Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Should the behavior of “Apply All“ be changed? We should mimic the behavior that Purchase Team has developed. \\xa0 \\xa0 2 How should the system handle existing documents that are currently sitting in:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , etc.? That is, should Location be optional or should it follow the configuration in Documents → Settings → All Documents (especially when it is Hidden or Required)? \\xa0  Please look at older implementations or a way to handle this scenario for existing documents. \\xa0 3 What transitions should we showcase when a user induces the “Location is missing” error in  ,   status or greater? \\xa0 \\xa0  To check existing behavior and get back to me with possible solutions. \\xa0 4 Where should the new error message be displayed? \\xa0Show it the same way it does for other accounting elements.',\n",

       "     'description': 'Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( — ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline. Success Criteria: Effective implementation of T&Cs management and assignment system enhancements. Improved flexibility and control for Admins and Buyers in handling T&Cs. Seamless integration with existing systems and processes. Positive feedback from primary stakeholders, Yukon and Maersk. Milestones: MVP - Minimum Viable Product: Product manager to validate assumptions and solution design with stakeholders. Engineering to complete    MUP - Minimum Useable Product:                                     Purchase Order: Allow Buyers to create and associate Ad-hoc T&Cs to a specific PO Purchase Order: Print the correct T&Cs on the PO PDF Vroozi Admin: Allow Admins to specify whether PO T&Cs can be updated via the POCR function POCR: Allow only the “PO Owner” to update T&Cs via POCR POCR: Record and display T&Cs changes done on a PO, in the PO Document Change History Integration team  → SPIKE: Integration team needs to investigate impact on NBCU, if T&Cs can be updated vai POCR Payables team  → Supplier Portal: Display PO T&Cs in the Vroozi Supplier Portal Payables team  → Supplier Portal: Ensure SP users are able to Confirm / Dispute T&Cs changes on a PO updated via POCR MLP - Minimum Lovable Product: Vroozi Admin: Figure out how to introduce an “Apply to All” option for associations SPIKE: Investigate how we can compute, store and display a fine grained “Diff” for the T&Cs content, when updated by an Admin         Integration team  →     POCR: Allow Admins to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Allow Central Reciever to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Ensure that T&Cs updates on POs; done via POCR, are reviewed and approved by the “PO Owner” Vroozi PMAN: Allow Buyers, Admins, Central Receivers to create custom T&Cs and save them in their user profile for reuse at a later date Vroozi PMAN: Allow users to view and manage their custom T&Cs from their “My Data” screen \\xa0 The wireframes for this project can also be found here:',\n",

The system should show the assigned T&Cs on the PO, exactly where they’re displayed today on the DRAFT PO. Towards the bottom of the document, above the action buttons. The T&Cs section should ONLY be visible if there are T&Cs assigned to the PO. The height of the T&Cs section should be capped, to be the same as the adjacent “Notes to Supplier” section. The T&Cs section should be titled “Terms & Conditions” This section should display the unique name of the assigned T&Cs, in a type-ahead field This section should display the content of the assigned T&Cs If the content doesn’t fit into the fixed height of this section, it should be truncated and the body of text should end with an ellipsis ( … ), so the user understands that there is more content. This section should include a new button with a “pencil” icon on it.  This button should be inline with the T&Cs name field When the user hovers over this button, they should see a tool-tip with the text “Create new Terms & Conditions“ \\xa0 What should happen when the user clicks into the type-ahead field with the T&C name in it? When the user clicks into the type-ahead field … The system should automatically remove the previously selected T&Cs from the field The system should display a drop-down menu listing upto 10 of the active, applicable T&Cs that could be assigned to the current PO This list should be scrollable if needed If the BE returns more applicable T&Cs as options, than can be shown in this list, the last element in the list should be an ellipsis ( … ), so the user can understand that there’s more data There should be no change to the name or the content of the T&Cs that are already assigned to the PO. if the user clicks away from this field, the field’s state should revert back to what it was before the user clicked into it. \\xa0 What should happen when the user types is the type-ahead field with the T&C name in it? if the user begins typing into the type-ahead field, the system should search through the list of applicable T&Cs returned by the BE for this particular PO. The user should only be able to trigger the search function by typing in the name of a set of active, applicable T&Cs from their unitID. The search function should not be triggered till the user has entered at least 2 chars. The system should present a filtered/narrowed result set with every additional character entered by the user. The list of options visible in the drop-down list should update in real-time as the result set is updated. \\xa0 What should happen when the user clicks on one of the options listed in the type-ahead field with the T&C name in it?

When the user clicks on this button, the UI controls on the modal should disappear, and be replaced by a UI to facilitate the creation of an Ad-hoc set of T&Cs for the current PO.  The new UI should have the same title for the modal; “Terms & Conditions“.  This new UI should have the same 2 additional action buttons at the bottom: Cancel Save The main section of the modal should include a “back” button allowing the user to exit the T&Cs creation UI and go back to the original state of the modal.  inline with this back button, there should be a text label “Create Custom Terms & Conditions“ There should be a “?” help icon next to this label If the user hovers over it, they should see a tool-tip with the text “Create a new set of custom Terms & Conditions that will be associated with this Purchase Order. This new set of Terms & Conditions will not be available for use outside of this Purchase Order.“ The user should have access to the following input fields:  Name Description “ Content ” The Name field should be required The Description field should be optional The “ Content ” field should be identical to the rich text editing system shown in the Admin Panel for authoring custom T&Cs. This field should be required.  What should happen when the user clicks on the “Create new Terms & Conditions“ button, on the T&Cs section on the POCR document? When the user clicks on the new “Create new Terms & Conditions“ button on the main DRAFT PO screen …  The system should display the Terms & Conditions modal  The modal should directly open in the Ad-hoc T&Cs creation mode as described in the section titled “ What should happen when the user clicks on the “Create new Terms & Conditions“ button, on the modal? “ What should happen when the user clicks on the “back“ button, on the create T&Cs view on the modal? The user should be navigated back to the parent screen on the Terms & Conditions modal, displaying the currently assigned T&Cs content in it.

How can a Buyer get back to the Ad-hoc T&Cs they were working on, and continue editing the content? Change the text in tooltip from “Create custom Terms & Conditions” to “Edit custom Terms & Conditions” The icon should stay as it is. When the user clicks on the “Edit custom Terms & Conditions” button The T&Cs details modal should reopen The modal should open in the state used for editing the Ad-hoc T&Cs The relevant fields on the UI should be pre-populated with the appropriate content, from the Ad-hoc T&Cs already assigned to the document \\xa0 How can a Buyer get to the Ad-hoc T&Cs they were working on and continue editing the content, after clicking on the “show more …” link? If the Ad-hoc T&Cs has more content than is displayed on the PO document itself, and the user clicks on the “show more …” link The T&Cs details modal should reopen The modal should open in the state used for editing the Ad-hoc T&Cs The relevant fields on the UI should be pre-populated with the appropriate content, from the Ad-hoc T&Cs already assigned to the document If the user happens to click on the “back” button in this screen, they should be navigated by the system to the read-only view of the modal, with the contents of the Ad-hoc T&Cs displayed on the screen. The user should be able to use the type-ahead field to select and preview another set of custom T&Cs from the unitID’s library of available T&Cs. Alternate custom T&Cs; from the unitID library, will only be applied to the PO if the user clicks on the “Save Changes” button. They should be able to get back to the editing view by clicking on the “Edit custom Terms & Conditions” button on this screen. \\xa0 How can the user save their updates/changes to the Ad-hoc T&Cs? On the T&Cs details modal; with the Ad-hoc T&Cs UI displayed and prepopulated with content, the user should be able to modify the values in any of the fields on the UI Instead of the “Save” button, if the user has made any changes in any of the fields, the label of that button should read “Save Changes“ Clicking on this button should assign the updated Ad-hoc T&Cs to the current document \\xa0 Expected behavior for the “Pencil” button on the T&Cs section on the POCR screen: The icon for the button should remain a pencil.

TBD … If required, please provide details of what the expected effect of this data fix will be: TBD … \\xa0 How should the auto-assigned T&Cs be displayed on the POCR screen? The system should show the assigned T&Cs on the PO, exactly where they’re displayed on the DRAFT PO. Towards the bottom of the document, above the action buttons. The T&Cs section should ONLY be visible if there are T&Cs assigned to the PO. The height of the T&Cs section should be capped, to be the same as the adjacent “Notes to Supplier” section. The T&Cs section should be titled “Terms & Conditions” This section should display the unique name of the assigned T&Cs This section should display the content of the assigned T&Cs If the content doesn’t fit into the fixed height of this section, it should be truncated and the body of text should end with an ellipsis ( … ), so the user understands that there is more content. \\xa0 When should the system display a “Show more …” link in the T&Cs section? If the T&Cs section is showing truncated content, then there should be a “Show more …” link below the body of text. Whether or not this link is visible, should NOT affect the total height of the T&Cs section. This link should be clickable by the user. \\xa0 What should the user see when they click on the “Show more …” link? When the user clicks on the “Show more …” link, the system should display a modal to the user. The document behind the modal should appear in a dimmed state; as is standard across the application. This modal should have the tile “Terms & Conditions“ This modal should display the unique name of the assigned T&Cs, in a type-ahead field This modal should display the optional description of the assigned T&Cs If there is no description provided for the assigned T&Cs, then the description field should NOT be visible on the UI. This modal should display the entire content of the assigned T&Cs The section of the modal displaying the T&Cs content should be scrollable, if there is more content than can be displayed in the section’s viewport. This modal should have a standard “x” button on the top right to close the modal and return the user to the DRAFT PO screen. This modal should have 2 additional action buttons at the bottom: Cancel Save What should happen when the user clicks into the type-ahead field with the T&C name in it?

The user should only be able to trigger the search function by typing in the name of a set of active, applicable T&Cs from their unitID. The search function should not be triggered till the user has entered at least 2 chars.  The system should present a filtered/narrowed result set with every additional character entered by the user.  The list of options visible in the drop-down list should update in real-time as the result set is updated.

But now If we select CUSTOM from  Terms and Conditions Select dropDown  then go for a POCR now we able to assign custom T&Cs ? \\xa0On the POCR screen, when deciding what to show in the T&Cs section, there are 2 conditions that need to be evaluated:  What T&Cs information is present in the source PO? What is the current set of configurations, at the time the Buyer is doing the POCR?  If the source PO does not have any T&Cs data in it, and the unitID is currently configured to not use any T&Cs, then the system should NOT display the T&Cs section on POCR screen.  If the source PO does not have any T&Cs data in it, and the unitID is currently configured to use the default T&Cs, then the system should NOT display the T&Cs section on POCR screen. If the source PO does not have any T&Cs data in it, and the unitID is currently configured to use custom T&Cs, then the system should show the T&Cs section with the taxt “ There aren’t any Terms & Conditions assigned to this Purchase Order currently. “ Whether there will be a type-ahead, or a button to create Ad-hoc T&Cs will depend on the current user’s permissions.  If the source PO has T&Cs assigned to it, and the unitID is currently configured to not use any T&Cs, then the system should display the T&Cs section on the POCR screen, but in read-only mode. With the “ show more … “ feature working if the content of the T&Cs is greater than what can be shown in the limited space on the POCR document.

       "      'description': 'This ticket MUST be released along with:     Business Case: Following the updates done in   and  , a key element is missing: the ability to apply split accounting assignments to selected line items. This enhancement aims to provide users with the ability to assign accounting splits based on quantity, value, or percent using the new Apply to All modal. We also want to enabled users to define presets with split accounting from the “Manage Presets” tab, and then use them from the “Changes to be Applied” tab. Acceptance Criteria: Note : The behavior described in this ticket MUST work consistently on all line items, regardless of how they were added to the document: Manually via the “ Add Item ” function. Created via  OCR . Created via  cXML . Created via  Supplier Portal . Which Customer should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, if memos are enabled. What pages should this change impact?  Invoice and Memo documents. Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Processor, AP Manager, AP Coder, AP Approver with coding access, Employee/Buyer with coding access, Admin. How should this change work? UI Enhancement: A new field labeled \"Split Account Assignment\" should be added to the Accounting section of the Apply to All modal. The new field should have the following options: <blank>, \"None\", \"By Quantity\", \"By Value\", \"By Percent\", with <blank> as the default. Functionality for <Blank>: By default, the <blank> option should be selected. Selecting this option should maintain the current UI state. Upon application, the system should NOT make any changes to the split accounting status of the selected items. Instead, any fields which have values specified in them, should be updated across all the available accounting segments of all the selected line items. Functionality for \\'None\\': Selecting \"None\" should maintain the current UI state. Upon application, the system should overwrite existing split accounting segments with the new data provided, making all fields in the Accounting section required. Functionality for \\'By Quantity\\': Selecting \"By Quantity\" should dynamically add at least two sets of accounting fields. Users should be able to add additional sets of identical fields. A required field labeled \"Quantity #1\", \"Quantity #2\", etc., should be added to each set. Upon application, the system should overwrite existing split accounting segments with the new data provided, making all fields in the Accounting section required. Functionality for \\'By Value\\': Selecting \"By Value\" should replicate the functionality of \"By Quantity\", replacing \"Quantity #n\" with \"Value #n\" fields. Functionality for \\'By Percent\\': Selecting \"By Percent\" should replicate the functionality of \"By Quantity\", replacing \"Quantity #n\" with \"Percent #n\" fields. Application of Changes: The system should evaluate if the user\\'s specified changes are compatible with each pre-selected line item. Compatibility for split accounting by  quantity  will be determined by comparing the sum of the quantities specified by the user, across all accounting segments, to the total order quantity of the selected line item. Compatible: If the two values  are equal , then the change can be applied. Incompatible: If the two values  are not equal , then the changes can be applied with a warning message within the “yellow” panel ( following existing system behavior for Invoice / Memo documents ). Compatibility for split accounting by  value  will be determined by comparing the sum of the values specified by the user, across all accounting segments, to the total order value of the selected line item.  Compatible: If the two values  are equal , then the change can be applied. Incompatible: If the two values  are not equal , then the changes can be applied with a warning message within the “yellow” panel ( following existing system behavior for Invoice / Memo documents ). Compatibility for split accounting by  percent  will be determined by comparing the sum of the percentages specified by the user, across all accounting segments. Compatible: If this sum adds up to “ 100 ”, then the change can be applied. Incompatible: If the sum  does not  add up to “ 100 ” or is above “ 100 ”, then the changes can be applied with a warning message within the “yellow” panel ( following existing system behavior for Invoice / Memo documents ). Error Notification: If any of the user’s selected items were updated with incompatible quantity, value or percent, and the reason for that was related to the split accounting that the user was trying to apply, then the system should display a persistent notification on the UI, informing the user about which items had incompatible values and providing a clear explanation of why they were incompatible. ( following existing system behavior for Invoice / Memo documents ). This message should be displayed on screen using the pattern for document level warning messages; within the “ yellow ” panel. If the user was trying to apply split accounting by  quantity , this message should highlight the line item number # with a warning message saying - “ Total split quantity not adding up to \\'<1>\\'   “. If the user was trying to apply split accounting by  value , this message should highlight the line item number # with a warning message saying - “ Total split value not adding up to ‘<2>’   “. If the user was trying to apply split accounting by  percent , this message should highlight the line item number # with a warning message saying - “ Total split percentage not adding up to 100% “. < 1 > :   Line item quantity . < 2 > :   Line item total . Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams.

Additionally, Our system does not; currently, natively support many-to-many relationships between company info & accounting info master data objects. Many customers have worked around this limitation by creating duplicate accounting elements, each of which is connected to a different parent element.

Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Processor, AP Manager, AP Coder, AP Approver with coding access, Employee/Buyer with coding access, Admin. How should this change work? Apply to All Functionality: There should be a \"Apply to All\" button in the application\\'s user interface. This button should NOT be visible to any Employee / Buyer user that has coding restrictions enabled in their user record. The user can select one or more items before clicking the \"Apply to All\" button. Clicking the \"Apply to All\" button should open a modal dialog containing a dynamic form with multiple input fields. This modal should only show fields for the Org / Accounting elements that are enabled in the unitID. By default, all input fields in the modal should be blank. All input fields in the modal should be optional for the user to fill in. The system should only allow a user to set values in these fields that are currently “_not deleted_” and active in the unitID. Parent-Child Relationship: Some fields in the modal are considered parent elements, and others are considered child elements. If a user fills in a parent field, the system should restrict the user to selecting values in the child fields that are linked to the selected value in the parent field. This filtering mechanism must be driven off of the parent-child relationship of these elements in the unitID’s master data If a parent field has only one possible value for a child field, that value should be automatically filled in by the system. Mandatory Child Fields: If the user fills in a parent field, the system must make it mandatory for the user to fill in all linked child fields before allowing the changes to be applied to the selected items. Validation and Notification: Note: The requirements documented below mean that either the user’s entire set of specified changes will be applied to the line item, or nothing will be updated. There will not be a scenario where the user specifies changes to “ n ” child fields, but the system only updates some fraction of those “ n ” fields; as they were the only ones that would be valid with the existing parent field values on the line item. In this scenario, the entire set of specified changes will be discarded, and the user will be shown the appropriate error message. If the user is only updating child fields, the system should allow the user to apply changes. During the application of changes, the system must evaluate each selected item to determine if the user\\'s specified change can work with the values already provided in the selected item\\'s parent fields. If a user\\'s specified change is incompatible with the existing parent field values, that item should remain unchanged. The system should display a persistent notification on the UI, informing the user about which items were not updated and providing a clear explanation of why they were not updated. This message should be displayed on screen using the pattern for document level warning messages; within the “*yellow*” panel. This message should highlight the items that weren’t updated using the text “* < 1 > # < 2 > not updated. The specified change conflicts with one or more of the company info or accounting elements that are already present on < 3 >. *“ < 1 > :  If there’s only one item in this list, then the system should use the word “* Item ”. But, if there are multiple items in this list, then the system should use the word “ Items *“. < 2 > :  If there’s only one item in this list, then the system should only display the index number of that item and follow that with the word “* was *”. If there are multiple consecutive items in the list, the system use the pattern  [index number of the 1st item in the list] - [index number of the last item in the list]  and follow that with the word  “were“ . If there are multiple items in the list, but they’re not consecutive, the system should list the index numbers of all those items separated by commas, with the last item in that list being separated by an “* and *”. The end of the list should be followed by the word  “were“ . < 3 > :  If there’s only one item in this list, then the system should use the word “* this Item ”. But, if there are multiple items in this list, then the system should use the word “ these Items *“. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams.

       "      'description': 'Business Case: Based on the work done in  , we need to enable the new line item grid to be able to display multiple values per cell, in case an item has more than one value assigned to it in that field. A good example of such a use case would be items with split accounting segments assigned to them. A single item might have multiple combinations of accounting elements assigned to it, resulting in there being multiple cost objects, GL accounts, customer references etc. assigned to said item. Acceptance Criteria: Which Customer should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true (and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, if memos are enabled). What pages should this change impact?  The invoice and memos line items. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who have to access the Invoice / Memo document. How should this change work? For line items that have multiple values in a given field, the UI should display the “ 1st value  and then  +x more ”, in any cell that has more than one value. The “ x ” in this keyword is the count of the elements that are additionally associated with this line item in this field. If a certain line item is showing “ +x more ”, and the user clicks on this field in the grid, the system should show the remaining values for that field, associated with that specific line item, in a tooltip. If there are multiple Account Categories, then the tooltip should display “ Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order / Profit Center   :   Accounting object code   +   Name ”. Example:  Cost Center: 100 - Marketing If there are multiple splits for other accounting elements, then the tooltip should display - “ Accounting object code + Name ” (screenshot provided below). Example:  100 - Marketing Line item fields/grid columns that may include multiple values: Account Category Cost Center ( the label for this field is configurable by the Admin ) / WBS Element / Internal Order / Profit Center GL Account ( the label for this field is configurable by the Admin ) Customer ( the label for this field is configurable by the Admin ) Class ( the label for this field is configurable by the Admin ) Project ( the label for this field is configurable by the Admin ) Location Type ( the label for this field is configurable by the Admin ) Location ( the label for this field is configurable by the Admin ) Do we need a data fix for existing customers?

General rules for the line item grid: If a certain column does not have any data to display, it should just show up as “N/A” in the grid for that column. The user should  NEVER  be able to remove the following columns from the grid: Item selection Checkbox # Line item number Description Price Qty Total Action Grid configuration control column (gear icon) If the user adds more columns than can be displayed on the UI, the system should allow the user to scroll horizontally; within the grid, to view the additional columns. If the user chooses to show any Company Info or Accounting related columns on the grid, the UI should display both the code & name for that field’s value; from the line item. Default state of the line item grid: By default, the line item grid should continue showing the same set of columns as it does today: Item selection Checkbox # Line item number Description GL Account Price Qty Tax Total This column header should continue to display the same help tip: Total excludes \\'Tax\\', \\'Discount\\' and \"Shipping Charges\" Action <Gear icon> Allow users to update which columns are included in the line item grid: The user should be able to click on the <gear icon> Doing so will display a drop-down menu to the user; similar to the grid configuration menu on the Draft PR / Track ‘All’ Invoices screens. This menu should have a Blue header component. This menu item should be titled “ Column Preferences “. This menu should have a search box, titled “ Find a column … “. The user should be able to lookup a specific column by entering its name in this field. This field should auto-filter the list of columns, as the user types. The system should match the user’s entered text, with the column name from left to right. There is no need for token based matching. ( Ask Naufil for clarification about this ) The matching logic should be case insensitive. This menu should have a clickable link in it; under the search box, titled “ Restore Defaults “. Clicking this should undo any modifications that the user has done to the checked/unchecked status of the individual options in the list, and restore the list to the user’s default preferences. This menu should have a list of columns that can be included in the line item grid. This list should have the following options: # (line item number) Type Description GL Account (  I moved the GL here, so we keep it in the same order) Price Quantity Category Tax Code Discount Shipping Charges Tax UoM Company Code Purchasing Organization ( ) Plant Account Category ( ) Customer ( ) Project ( ) Class ( ) Location ( ) Location Type ( ) Total (   I’ve added the total here that was missing) Allow the user to apply their desired changes to the line item grid: Once the user has made their selections, they can either click on either the “ Cancel ” or “ Done ” buttons in this menu. If the user clicks on the “ Cancel ” button: none of the user’s changes will be applied to the line item grid. The grid configuration menu will automatically close. If the user clicks on the “ Done ” button: The user’s specified changes will be applied to the line item grid. These changes should be saved, and used every time the user opens up the invoice/memo document. The grid configuration menu will automatically close.

       "      'description': 'Business Case: The system should run the accounting string validations at the  Apply to All  modal. Acceptance Criteria: General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Creation: Currently, the system requires the definition of the required and optional Accounting/Organization objects in the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service . If the value in the optional field is given at the line item, the system considers it for the accounting validation in addition to the required fields. If the value in the optional field is not given for the line item, the system considers only the values in the required fields for the accounting validation. Based on that, the system decided what fields should be compared in the accounting validation with the accounting string master data. Accounting Validation on Apply to All modal: Changes to be Applied tab: On the  Changes to be Applied  tab, there are two ways to fill in the fields: Select the  preset. Select the values individually. Once the user has provided value in any or all fields required/optional for accounting validation and clicks the  Apply Changes  button, the system should run the accounting validation for the line items selected for the Apply to All.  The  Apply Changes  button labels should be changed to  Validating Data  with the in-process icon. ( refer to the Document Submit button ) The Apply to All modal should disappear if no accounting errors are found. The selected line items should be updated accordingly. The Apply to All modal should disappear if accounting errors are found. The selected line items should be updated accordingly. The accounting validation error message should appear above the line item grid on the document stating the line items selected for Apply to All and their invalid accounting strings. The user can go further to the line item individually to rectify the accounting string issue. The following Red highlighted section is not required at this point. On the  Changes to be Applied  tab, there are two ways to fill in the fields: Select the  preset. Select the values individually. The system should run the accounting validation as soon as it finds values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  on the  Changes to be Applied  tab of the  Apply to All  modal. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system green message. The message should disappear in 3 seconds. If the system finds the accounting string errors, the system should show the following message This message should persist until the user resolves the issue. The system should run the accounting validation as soon as it finds values in all the required and optional fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service Changes to be Applied  tab of the  Apply to All  modal. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system green message. The message should disappear in 3 seconds. If the system finds the accounting string errors, the system should show the following message This message should persist until the user resolves the issue. The error message should be as follows when the line item is not split. Accounting String Error  The following Accounting String has been deactivated  → Error Code 02 The following Accounting String is not valid (does not exist)  → Error Code 01 Company Code = <Code> - <Description> Plant Code = <Code> - <Description> Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order = <Code> - <Description> GL Account = <Code> - <Description> … (display the rest of the elements in the same order the line items in separate lines) There should be a separate error message for each invalid accounting string associated with different splits on the  Changes to be Applied  tab of the  Apply to All  modal. The following is the pattern of the error message that should be followed: Accounting String Error - split #…  → Display all splits of the item containing that Accounting String The following Accounting String has been deactivated  → Error Code 02 The following Accounting String is not valid (does not exist)  → Error Code 01 Company Code = <Code> - <Description> Plant Code = <Code> - <Description> Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order = <Code> - <Description> GL Account = <Code> - <Description> … (display the rest of the elements in the same order the line items in separate lines) The message should read “Accounting String Error - split # (comma separated).“. The message should read “Accounting String Error - split # (- separated).“ in case of splits in the sequence has the same accounting string error. After the message should tell the user why the selected accounting string combination of the mentioned line items was marked invalid. Either the string was deactivated. Or the string does not exist in Vroozi Master Data. The message should display the associated accounting combination with the mentioned splits in the strings. Please review the error message on the documents above the line item grid. The system should keep the  Apply Changes  button disabled until the accounting validation error message persists. Please note that the R&D done so far does not show any instance in which a certain accounting object is required in the accounting configuration service and is optional on the line item modal.  So making this the basis for our assumption, we can say that the above-scenario can happen technically but not practically. QA can run such scenarios in their testing activity.  If there is any custom accounting validation error message that exits, it should also be visible on the Apply to All modal with the main message. (refer to  )  All AC points mentioned above should be implemented for the following documents where users can access the  Apply to All  Modal. PR CR PO Create PO Wizard POCR All AC points mentioned above should be implemented for the following users who can take action on the documents listed above. Admin Requester Sourcing Approver (with Editing rights) Financial Approver (with Coding rights) Buyer Central Receiver Any other user( QA: Please do the impact analysis and let me know If I have missed any user ) Manage Presets: All the acceptance criteria mentioned in the  Changes to be Applied tab  should be implemented for the  Manage Presets  tab of the  Apply  to All modal. On selecting the existing preset on the Manage Presets tab, the system should not run accounting validation until the user changes values in the fields required for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  on the  Manage Presets  tab of the  Apply to All  modal. Testing Strategy: ,  , Kindly document the testing Strategy here in the panel that how the team is going to cover all the mentioned documents and users while testing the Accounting Validation at  Apply to All  Modal.',\n",

Buyers can select the Terms and Conditions for a specific Purchase Order\\n(PO). In addition, Buyers will be able to create, manage or update the Terms and\\nConditions on a draft PO prior to submission, or via a Purchase Order Change Request\\n(POCR). All changes and updates made to the Terms and Conditions in the Purchase\\nOrder will be recorded in the PO Change History.\\n\\n# Resolutions\\n- Updated Japanese translation for PO Close notification email.\\n- Also, under translation, user group names will now be translated and displayed\\n     accurately within Vroozi.\\n- Resolved an issue where the Location field was not updating correctly on the\\n     Invoice document when using \"Apply to All\".\\n- Invoices created and processed at the exact same time would create duplicate\\n     Invoice numbers, which would cause errors when posting the invoices to\\n     external systems. The system will no longer create duplicate invoice numbers.\\n- This release fixes an issue in the Apply to All feature where Quantity, Value, and\\n     Amount fields in the \"Changes to be Applied\" tab were not populated with\\n     preset values.\\n- Resolves an issue where users were able to approve their own PRs if they were\\n     part of the defined approval chain in the new dynamic workflow. Now, if the\\n     requester or the person that owns the PO in the case of a POCR is part of the\\n     approval chain, the system will automatically skip that individual, and move onto\\n     the next approver in the chain.\\n- Updated the email Buyers receive for POs or PO Change Requests (POCR) for\\n     visibility into the type of document they are receiving.'},\n",

Integration_Jmeter Project Should be in the system Executing Combine threads of [Address, Plant Code, Payment Term, Tax Codes, Company Code] together  Actual Result: I have observed a few issues and discussed them with the OPS team. During the execution of test cases, which involve sequential requests, I occasionally encounter authorization issues, causing test cases to fail. I'm uncertain whether this is a gateway or API issue. After discussing with the OPS team, we identified that throttling is enabled on the stage environment but not on the devQA environment. Despite this difference, we need to pinpoint the root cause of these intermittent authorization issues, as they are reproducible. Case 1: Executing on RC-2024-6 and response time of all the requests are 7:15 sec see below image top right corner. Case 2: Executing on RC-2024-7 and response time of all the requests are  17:28 sec see below image top right corner. Expected Result: The pre authentication does not slow the API executions. This difference is high, we need to make similar as we have in RC-2024-6.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( — ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline. Success Criteria: Effective implementation of T&Cs management and assignment system enhancements. Improved flexibility and control for Admins and Buyers in handling T&Cs. Seamless integration with existing systems and processes. Positive feedback from primary stakeholders, Yukon and Maersk. Milestones: MVP - Minimum Viable Product: Product manager to validate assumptions and solution design with stakeholders. Engineering to complete    MUP - Minimum Useable Product:                                     Purchase Order: Allow Buyers to create and associate Ad-hoc T&Cs to a specific PO Purchase Order: Print the correct T&Cs on the PO PDF Vroozi Admin: Allow Admins to specify whether PO T&Cs can be updated via the POCR function POCR: Allow only the “PO Owner” to update T&Cs via POCR POCR: Record and display T&Cs changes done on a PO, in the PO Document Change History Integration team  → SPIKE: Integration team needs to investigate impact on NBCU, if T&Cs can be updated vai POCR Payables team  → Supplier Portal: Display PO T&Cs in the Vroozi Supplier Portal Payables team  → Supplier Portal: Ensure SP users are able to Confirm / Dispute T&Cs changes on a PO updated via POCR MLP - Minimum Lovable Product: Vroozi Admin: Figure out how to introduce an “Apply to All” option for associations SPIKE: Investigate how we can compute, store and display a fine grained “Diff” for the T&Cs content, when updated by an Admin         Integration team  →     POCR: Allow Admins to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Allow Central Reciever to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Ensure that T&Cs updates on POs; done via POCR, are reviewed and approved by the “PO Owner” Vroozi PMAN: Allow Buyers, Admins, Central Receivers to create custom T&Cs and save them in their user profile for reuse at a later date Vroozi PMAN: Allow users to view and manage their custom T&Cs from their “My Data” screen \\xa0 The wireframes for this project can also be found here:',\n",

The system attempts to notify the designated PO supplier of this change. This is happening because the system does not correctly identify these changes as ONLY being relevant to the Buying Organization. We need to update this logic, to be able to track which T&C changes the supplier should be notified of, versus which one’s they should not be updated about.  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisite(s): The unitID should be configured to use the new enhanced T&Cs functionality.  The unitID must be configured to use Custom Terms & Conditions.  The unitID must be configured to allow POCRs.  The unitID must be configured to allow changes to the T&Cs of a PO, via the POCR process.  The user doing the POCR must be a Buyer.  The Buyer must have the correct permissions; to create Ad-hoc T&Cs, assigned to them.  The PO being acted upon must have already been sent to a vendor.  The PO being acted upon must already have Ad-hoc T&Cs assigned to it.  What should happen when the user does a POCR, and updates the non-content portion of the assigned Ad-hoc T&Cs on a PO? In this scenario, the Buyer has ONLY updated the T&Cs on the PO, and specifically only the name, the description or both on the Ad-hoc T&Cs. Most importantly, the Buyer has NOT modified the content of the Ad-hoc T&Cs.  The system should record the change(s) made to the T&Cs and display them on the CR, and in the PO document history UI on the Buying org side.  The system should NOT …  Update the PO version due to this change. Include the details of this change in the PO PDF (if communicated to the vendor). Display a change event for this modification in the PO document history, in the Supplier Portal.

Given  an Admin is assigning Company Code restrictions, When  the Admin selects Company Codes in the restriction field, Then  the Admin should only be able to select active and non-deleted Company Codes. Given  an AP Manager has no Company Code restrictions assigned, When  they access the system, Then  they should have access to Invoices and Memos belonging to all Company Codes, similar to the current system behavior.  (Default Setting) Given  an Admin is assigning Company Code restrictions to an AP Manager, When  the Admin selects one or more Company Codes in the \"Company Code Restriction\" field, Then  the AP Manager should only be able to view, take action on, and process Invoice and Memo documents associated with those selected Company Codes. Given  an AP Manager has Company Code restrictions applied to their profile, When  the Admin or AP Manager accesses the \\'My Document Defaults\\' section in the \\'Edit User\\' modal, Then  the \\'Company Code\\' field should only display the Company Codes that have been assigned as restrictions in the Access section.

       "      'description': \"User Story: As an AP user , I want the settings in Documents → Settings → All Documents to dictate if  Cost Center  /  WBSE  /  Internal Order  /  Profit Center  should be optional, or required on AP documents  so that  the behavior is consistent on all documents. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change?  The system uses the settings in Documents → Settings → All Documents to dictate if Cost Center / WBSE / Internal Order / Profit Center should be optional, or required on AP documents. Which customers should this change impact? All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true, and All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, and All customers who have PAYMENT_REQUEST = true What pages should this change impact?  The invoice, memo and  payment request  pages. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to edit an AP document, namely: The document owner (AP Processor/Manager), Assignee, e.g. an AP Coder, an Exception Handler, an Approver, and Any AP Manager. Payment Requester How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites: Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Admin has enabled one or more of these accounting objects in Master Data → Accounting page. Cost Center. WBSE. Internal Order. Profit Center. The Admin has selected one of the following against the Cost Center / WBSE / Internal Order / Profit Center field in the Documents → Settings → All Documents page. The behavior described below comes into play in the following situations, that is, in any editable state of an AP document: Document is in  ,  , or  Document being edited in   or   statuses. Document being edited while it is pending approval. Document being edited after it is approved, in   or   statuses. Document being edited after it is posted, in   status or greater. Feature toggle -   is ON. ASSUMPTIONS : If there are more than 1 accounting category turned ON for a client then they all will be Required / Optional / Hidden at the same time. ANALYSIS : Looking at the data from all of our existing clients using the AP module, there doesn’t seem to be anyone who has different set of document settings if there were multiple accounting categories active. Ignore Vroozi Validation in the screenshot provided below as it is our Test account on Production. In the screenshot below,  Required (ON) = The client is using this Accounting category and has made it a Required field. Required (OFF) = The client is not using this Accounting category but has it as a Required field in the BE. Optional (ON) = The client is using this Accounting category and has made it an Optional field. Optional (OFF) = The client is not using this Accounting category but has it as an Optional field in the BE. Hidden (ON) = The client is using this Accounting category and has made it a Hidden field. Hidden (OFF) = The client is not using this Accounting category but has it as a Hidden field in the BE. (ON) = The client is using this Accounting category but has no document setting choice selected (assuming PR line item config feature toggle is OFF) (OFF) = The client is not using this Accounting category and has no document setting choice selected (assuming PR line item config feature toggle is OFF) (Setting visible) = The client has the plant / purchasing org setting available for the Admin to select from the UI and accordingly they can choose Required / Optional / Hidden. (Setting is not visible) = The client does not have the plant / purchasing org setting available for the Admin to select from the UI but Required / Optional / Hidden maybe selected from the BE. Blank = No info. Cost Center = REQUIRED The systems exhibits the current behavior . In any editable state (in any status), a user is able to save a line item without specifying a value in the Cost Center field. Errors: If Cost Center = blank/null, the system displays an error that the Cost Center is missing. Example :  Line Item #n Field 'Cost Center' missing. Line Item #n Exactly one of 'Cost Center', WBS Element, Internal Order or Profit Center required. Note :  I believe this error message shows up when there are multiple accounting categories enabled in the system. Cost Center = OPTIONAL In any editable state (in any status), a user is able to save a line item without specifying a value in the Cost Center field. The system should  not  show an error message, as soon as the user saves the line item. Errors: If Cost Center = blank/null, the system does  not  display an error saying that the Cost Center is missing. Transitions: There is no change in terms of the transitions that the system displays as a result of the Cost Center being blank/null. Cost Center = HIDDEN Implementation to be done in this ticket -    Cost Center = NONE SELECTED The system implements the Cost Center = Required, as the default behavior. This can happen if the client is not using the PURCHASE__COMPANY_ACCOUNTING_LINE_ITEM_CONFIGURATION feature toggle. Implement the  same  behavior for the remaining accounting categories as well - WBS Element Internal Order Profit Center Apply All: Important Note:  The system exactly mimics the behavior of the Apply All modal of PRs. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Potentially no. Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes, invoices and memos that are currently in the early stages of the invoice process, e.g.   or   status. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date \\xa0How will the system behave if the accounting category is not selected, and Cost Center, WBS, Profit Center, and Internal Order are optional? The system should  not  show an error message, if all the accounting categories are optional, the user has not chosen an accounting category and then the user saves the line item. The user is allowed to save the line item without choosing the accounting category. \\xa0   \\xa08/19/2024 \\xa0   \\xa08/20/2024 # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 How should the system handle the scenario where lets say Cost Center is Required but WBSE is Optional or where Cost Center is Required but Internal Order is Hidden? What error message should be displayed? The assumption based on our present client data is that if more than one accounting category is turned ON for a client, then all of them will be set to Required, Optional, or Hidden at the same time. Although this is not a typical use case, it is possible to set up accounting categories that differ from one another. If this occurs, and at least one accounting category is set to Required, then the default error message will be displayed: Exactly one of 'Cost Center', WBS Element, Internal Order or Profit Center required. In this unusual scenario, the user must fill in both the Accounting Category and the Value field to resolve the error message after saving the line item. \\xa0 Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Should the behavior of “Apply All“ be changed? We should mimic the behavior that Purchase Team has developed.\",\n",

       "      'description': 'Business Requirement : As an AP user , I want the system to check whether the  Customer  field in an AP document is  required  or  optional  by checking the document settings when a combination of accounting elements is associated with a customer in the line item. This change applies only to clients using the new feature toggle ( ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW__DOCUMENT_SETTINGS_CONFIGURATION ) and the customer accounting element. By default, the Customer field should remain optional for clients using the feature toggle. The system will only trigger document settings for the Customer field (whether required or optional) when a  combination of accounting elements  (such as company code, accounting category, GL account, or project) is  associated  with one or more  customer  accounting elements. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  The change ensures that the Customer field in AP documents becomes required or remains optional based on document settings,  triggered only when  accounting elements linked to a customer are present, for clients using the new feature toggle and customer accounting element. Which customers should this change impact? All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true, and All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true All customers who have PAYMENT_REQUEST = true What pages should this change impact?  The invoice, memo and payment request pages. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to edit an AP document. How should this feature work? Default Behavior : When the client is using the feature toggle ( ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW__DOCUMENT_SETTINGS_CONFIGURATION ) and the customer accounting element, the Customer field will be optional by default, regardless of the document settings. Triggering Document Settings : The system will check if the AP document line item contains accounting elements that are linked to a customer accounting element. If the accounting elements in the line item are associated with one or more customer accounting elements, the document settings will apply: If the document setting for the Customer field is set to \"Required,\" the field will become required.   If the document setting for the Customer field is set to \"Optional,\" the field will remain optional. The systems exhibits the current behavior. Document Settings Based on Accounting Elements : The system should evaluate combinations of accounting elements (e.g., company code, accounting category, GL account, or project) within the line item. If no valid combination of accounting elements linked to customer accounting elements exists, the Customer field will remain optional, regardless of the document settings. Apply to All : Apply to All implementation should work in a similar manner. Scope : This change applies only to clients using the new feature toggle and the customer accounting element feature. Next step (new ticket) - Fix the issue where customer value still remains in the field after removing one or more accounting elements from the line item that was associated with the customer. Make customer as a disabled / hidden field if the combination of accounting elements do no associate with any customer. If they associate with one or more customer, then the field will become active and allow the user to choose the customer value. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date',\n",

This allows companies to create invoice processing strategies across\\nmultiple company codes and restrict invoices that need to be processed by the relevant\\ncompany code.\\n\\nTo enable this feature, please contact support@vroozi.zendesk.com. When enabled,\\nAdmins configure the restriction under Accounts Payable > Settings >Inbox > Structured\\nDocument Submission Access Rules.\\n\\nThis feature is related to the Restricting Inbox Visibility for AP Managers feature that was\\nreleased in October 2024, where companies could restrict AP Managers to specific invoices\\ndefined in the inbox access rules (as opposed to AP Managers seeing all invoices).\\n\\nCurrently this feature is rolled out to AP Managers. In future releases, we plan to include AP\\nApprovers, AP Coders, and AP Auditor roles.\\n**[Image here]**\\n# Vroozi Purchase (Supplier)\\n## HIGHLIGHTING CANCELED LINE ITEMS IN AN UPDATED PO PDF\\nCanceled line items on a Purchase Order Change Request will now be displayed more\\nprominently on the PDF document that is sent to the supplier. This will provide better\\nvisibility into what line items were canceled on the new PO version.\\nThis feature will be available by default on all POCR documents that are sent to the supplier.\\n**[Image here]**\\n# Resolutions\\n-PRs that were auto-forwarded during Approval incorrectly display the Fallback\\n       Approver as part of the approval chain. The Fallback Approver will no longer\\n       display when a PR is auto-forwarded.\\n- The system will now account for deleted unreceived items in a PO Change\\n       Request (POCR) to update the PO status to RECEIVED.\\n- Notes will no longer be duplicated for rejected POCRs where the user updated\\n       the Supplier Notes.\\n- Users will be able to delete items on a rejected PO Change Request so they can\\n    update and resubmit.\\n- Users will be able to access the side panel on a mobile device when in landscape\\n    mode.\\n- The PO Search filter will now include POs created via Buy Route.\\n- When an admin eliminates roles in user profile, the change will be reflected in\\n    the user bulk upload.\\n- Resolved an inconsistency in quantity displayed. An internal catalog would\\n    appear as, 1, but when transferred to the cart the system would display 1.0.\\n- Eliminated the duplicate attachment when a Sourcing Reviewer uploaded an\\n    attachment on a POCR.\\n- Track All Invoices sort by feature would display the correct results in the table.\\n    However when a user entered the document view and navigated to the next\\n    invoice using the arrow buttons, the search results and sorting was not\\n    maintained. The next invoice in the document view will now follow the sort\\n    display.\\n- Resolved an issue where the GL Account was not displayed on the Invoice PDF.\\n   Users can now view, create, and process invoices from the hopper without losing\\n    their place in their work list eg: not be disrupted by new incoming invoices.\\n- Clients using the line-item configuration settings for AP documents, along with\\n    the Customer field, should see the document settings (Required, Optional, or\\n    Hidden) applied when valid accounting objects are used in the invoice line item\\n    that are associated with one or more valid customers in the system.\\n- Fixed the issue where AP users with both AP Manager and AP Processor roles\\n    were unable to see invoices in the Hopper.\\n   Resolved the issue where AP Processors could view and take action on Supplier\\n    Portal invoices from the Hopper that did not follow the Structured access rule.\\n- Clients who were not using any accounting categories received a \"Cost Center\\n    required\" error message on Non-PO OCR Invoice documents. This issue has\\n    been corrected.\\n- For non-catalog items without a Unit of Measure (UOM), the system assigns AU\\n    if that exists in the company\\'s UOM master data. Otherwise, UOM is left blank.\\n    For catalog items, the UOM is taken from the catalog UOM.\\n- Users can now update the delivery date or service period on line items during PO\\n    Change Requests.'},\n",

       "      'description': \"User Story : As an AP user, I want the system to store exception messages in the backend (BE) database whenever discrepancies (such as Goods Receipt, tax, price, line item exceptions) occur on an invoice document, so that these exceptions can be tracked and reported for better reconciliation management. Description : Currently, exception messages are displayed on invoice documents when discrepancies or missing goods receipts occur, but the exception data is not stored in the backend database. This limits the client's ability to track and report on why an invoice moves into reconciliation and how exceptions are resolved. To address this, the system should store these exception messages when an invoice transitions between statuses, specifically from Draft/Parked/Rejected/Posting Failed to Reconciliation and when the exceptions are resolved (such as when the invoice moves from Reconciliation back to Draft status). This functionality applies to Email-based (OCR/Non-OCR), cXML, and Supplier Portal invoices. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change?  The change involves storing exception messages for invoice discrepancies (such as Goods Receipt, tax, price, or line item exceptions) in the backend database when invoices transition between statuses, specifically from Draft/Parked to Reconciliation, and when exceptions are resolved as the invoice moves back to Draft or Pending or Approved. Which customers should this change impact?  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true What pages should this change impact?  Invoices:  Previous  status (Draft / Parked / Rejected / Posting Failed) →  Exception  →  Next  status (Draft). Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who will have access to reporting (Administrator / AP Manager dashboard) How should this feature work? When an invoice moves from  Previous  (Draft / Parked / Rejected / Posting Failed) status to  Reconciliation  status, the system stores the exception message in the backend database. Once the exception is resolved and the status changes from  Reconciliation  to  Next  status (Draft), the system records the resolution of the exception in the backend. Ensure exception tracking applies to  Email-based  ( OCR  /  Non-OCR ),  cXML , and  Supplier Portal  invoices. Ensure exception tracking applies to  Manually  created, and  Auto-processed  invoices. The backend system should store all relevant data, including what triggered the exception, the resolution, and  timestamps  for tracking purposes. The data should be accessible for reporting purposes to allow clients to track how exceptions were handled and resolved. System should be able to save these Exception messages - Missing GR exceptions . Additional exceptions . Line Item Price exception. Subtotal exception. Line Item Quantity exception. Total Quantity exception. Line Item Tax Exception. Total Tax exception. Line Item Shipping Exception. Total Shipping exception. Additional Line Item Exception. Additional Line Item Total exception. Accounting String Errors . System should be able to track resolutions for the exceptions - Resolutions submitted by the exception handler, such as Pay PO Price or Pay Invoice Price, etc. Note to REPORTING TEAM: These fields will never be updated, so we should base the updates on the createdDate field. Questions: Should we add true/false flags for exceptions to help with reporting? For example, did this invoice go through GR exceptions → True/False, or did this invoice have a tax exception → True/False? This might be redundant, as we are already saving the exceptions in the history, which I assume could be easily used to create a True/False query on the reporting side. Are there any other types of exception messages I’m missing here? For example, with Vertex tax, do we get exception messages for discrepancies? If so, are they considered under Line Item Tax exceptions or Total Tax exceptions? Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Maybe. Would this change impact existing documents?  Maybe. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  Yes. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date\",\n",

       "      'description': 'Background We aim to enhance the user experience and efficiency of Vroozi\\'s Smart Chat. To continuously improve its performance and ensure alignment with user needs, we must establish a feedback mechanism for chatbot interactions. Objective Implement a comprehensive feedback system for Vroozi Smart Chat, enabling users to provide ratings and comments on their chatbot experiences. This feature will allow us to gather valuable insights, identify areas for improvement, and enhance the overall quality of our AI-powered support. Requirements Develop a new API endpoint ( /intake-engine/chat/runs/{run_id}/feedback ) to accept user feedback. Create a user interface element (e.g., buttons and/or form) within the Smart Chat widget to collect feedback. Suggestion: Display thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons on row hover where is the AI message. After clicking the thumbs-down icon, prompt the user to select a reason and leave a comment Reason Selection: User must select one of the following reasons: Search results are not correct Cart was not updated correctly Purchase Request was not created Other Comment Field: The comment field is disabled by default with the placeholder text: “Please select the reason first.” Once a reason is selected, the comment field becomes enabled. If the reason “Other” is selected: The comment field is required. The placeholder text changes to: “Please provide the comment.” If a reason other than “Other” is selected: The comment field is optional. The placeholder text changes to: “(Optional) Add specific details.” Submit Button: The submit button is disabled by default. The submit button remains disabled until: A reason other than “Other” is selected, or The reason “Other” is selected and a comment is provided. Implement backend logic to store feedback data. Technical Details Store feedback data in LangSmith Sample Request: POST /intake-engine/chat/runs/030492d4-da72-4f8b-b808-f25084f2b7e6/feedback HTTP/1.1\\nHost: localhost:7700\\nX-Unit-ID: 2\\nX-User-ID: 2116\\nContent-Type: application/json\\nContent-Length: 105\\n\\n{\\n    \"score\": 0, // Feedback score: 1 = positive, 0 = negative\\n    \"value\": \"Unhelpful\", // Feedback category.

       "      'description': 'User Story : As a  User,  I want  the system to handle the approval chain display correctly when an Invoice/Memo/PRQ document is rejected and then edited or resubmitted,  So that  the system reflects the appropriate status of the approval process, whether it is recalculated or continued after the rejection event. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  When an Invoice/Memo/PRQ is rejected, the system will no longer display pending approvers after the rejection event. If the invoice is edited or resubmitted, the approval chain will either continue from the rejection point or, if accounting elements are updated, a new approval chain might be generated and displayed in separate collapsible tiles. Which customers should this change impact?  Clients using - Dynamic Workflow: Invoicing module. Memo module. Payment Request module. What pages should this change impact?  These pages the change would apply on - Invoice side panel page. PO based invoice approval is required. Non-PO based invoice approval is required. Memo side panel page. Memo approval is required. Payment Request side panel page. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to view an AP document. How should this feature work? Current Approval Chain Post-Rejection in View Mode : When an Invoice/Memo/PRQ document has been Rejected by an approver, and it is in  View Mode , then the system should display only the actions taken up to the rejection event. Example : There are 3 approvers - AP1, AP2, AP3. If AP1 approves and AP2 rejects the document, the approval chain will display AP1 as \"Approved\" and AP2 as \"Rejected.\" AP3 will not appear in the chain since the document did not proceed to that stage. This remains the final view if no changes or resubmissions are made. Recalculated Approval Chain Post-Rejection in Edit Mode : When the user switches the Rejected Invoice/Memo/PRQ document to  Edit Mode , the system will display the recalculated approval chain based on the document\\'s current state. If  no changes  are made to the  accounting elements , the approval chain will continue after the rejection event - if the document is in Edit mode with no changes made, if the document was in Edit mode with no changes made and then resubmitted for re-approval, if the document is in Edit mode with non-accounting changes made, if the document was in Edit mode with non-accounting changes made and then resubmitted for re-approval. Example : If AP1 approved and AP2 rejected, upon resubmission, the chain would show: AP1 Approved > AP2 Rejected > AP1  Approval Required  > AP2  Approval Required  > AP3  Approval Required . If the accounting elements are updated, and if a new approval rule applies, the system will: Create two collapsible tiles: Previous Approval Chain : Display the old approval chain up to the rejection (e.g., \"AP1 Approved > AP2 Rejected\"). Current Approval Chain : Display the new approval chain based on the new set of approvers (e.g., \"AP5  Approval Required  > AP6  Approval Required  > AP7  Approval Required \"). This will show the complete history of the invoice\\'s approval process in separate collapsible tiles. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All Teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date',\n",

Why Eureka Eureka is really beneficial when we need dynamic load balancing where multiple nodes can be added/removed without any manual intervention because each service in Eureka umbrella knows how many instance of each service is running dynamically. Step by step configuration is provided below. Register all client services to Eureka server using spring provided tools. If successfully registered the Eureka dashboard starts showing all the services that are registered with it. Once services are registered with Eureka, we can call them using the service discovery mechanism. There are couple of ways to achieve this. Using existing Rest Client with some modifications of how the restClient bean is constructed. Using Feign client by modifying all there existing legacy http calls(Recommended) Note:  Blockers we need to change each service and find out fall back method for rest template.

       "      'description': \"Business Case: As an External system user, I want to create/update the WBS Elements in bulk via the API. Acceptance Criteria: WBS Element Bulk Upsert POST API: A New upsert API should be built that allows the user to create/update the WBS Elements in bulk. The type of the API should be  POST . The user should be able to provide WBS Elements in bulk. The API should adhere to the API Payload size standards. This API should work asynchronously. The system should validate the WBS Elements information in the background. The system should let the API user know the API request is accepted. The API should issue a tracking number once the user posts the API. WBS Element Bulk Upsert Status GET API: Another API should be built that allows the user to get the status of the  WBS Element Bulk Upsert POST API  by providing the tracking number. The type of the API should be  GET . If the API does not return the status of the  WBS Element Bulk Upsert POST API , the system should return the error with details. This  WBS Element Bulk Upsert Status GET API  should return the following statuses of the  WBS Element Bulk Upsert POST API: If all the WBS Elements are created/updated successfully, the status should be  COMPLETED/SUCCESS. If some or all of the WBS Elements are still being created or updated, the stats should be  IN PROGRESS. If all of the WBS Elements are processed and some or all of them have validation errors, the status should be  COMPLETED WITH ERRORS. If all of the WBS Elements processing failed due to some technical error (e.g. time out) which can be fixed by retrying, the status should be  FAILURE. If some of the WBS Elements processing failed due to some technical error (e.g. time out) which can be fixed by retrying and some are processed successfully without any error, the status should be  PARTIAL   FAILURE/ COMPLETED WITH FAILURE. This  WBS Element Bulk Upsert Status GET API  should return the count of: Total items Items successfully uploaded Items failed(due to failure or validation error) The  WBS Element Bulk Upsert Status GET API  should return the state of each WBS Element in the API payload: The status should be  In Progress  if the WBS element is still in Progress. The status should be  Success  if the WBS element is created successfully. The status should be  Error  if the WBS element is not created due to: Validation Error Duplication Failure (time out etc) The response should also contain the details of each error type according to the set pattern of showcasing the error details. Documentation: There should be two new entries in the API Documentation in the  WBS Element  sub-menu of the  Master Data  menu Those two entries should be for the following APIs: WBS Element Bulk Upsert POST API ( please use the naming convention as per standards ) The API summary( appears next to the API endpoint ) should be ‘ Create or Update the WBS Element in bulk asynchronously’ . The details should be ' Create or Update the WBS Element in bulk asynchronously '. WBS Element Bulk Upsert Status GET API ( please use the naming convention as per standards ) The API summary( appears next to the API endpoint ) should be ‘ Get progress status of the bulk upsert WBS Element by Tracking ID ’. The details should be ' Get progress status of the bulk upsert WBS Element by Tracking ID '.

We also need to add createdBy, lastUpdatedBy fields in company setting in order to audit who and when the changes were made in company settings. The createdBy and createdDate fields are only added at the time of a new company/unitId creation. The values in these fields should be “System_UNIT-ID“ e.g. “System_2“ & current date respectively. The system must retain this information in the database. Multiple admins can change the company settings and system must audit who and when the admins are making these changes. In order to achieve this the application must populate these two fields lastUpdatedBy which should contains the userId of the loggedIn admin and updatedDate (current date - already working) The testing should be done across multiple companies updating the company settings. The testing should be done with creating a new company/unitId as well.',\n",

Once this collection is audited our the design should be flexible enough to support any collection of any database to be audited with only configuration changes required and should not require code changes (unless there is a customised solution required). There are three things that must be logged as part of the audit log entry Pre state pf the document New state of the document Root level change log between two states. a sample of the audit log entry should look like  unitId if applicable. {\\n\\t\"_id\" : mongoId,\\n\\t\"unitId\" : \"UNIT_ID\",\\n\\t\"operationType\" : type of the mongo operation,\\n\\t\"documentMongoId\" : the mongoId of the document being audited,\\n\\t\"createdDate\" : timestamp of the triggered event,\\n\\t\"fullDocument\" : {\\n\\t\\tA complete json of the updated state of the document.\\n\\t},\\n\\t\"fullDocumentBeforeChange\" : {\\n\\t\\tA complete json of the old state of the document.\\n\\t},\\n\\t\"changeLog\" : {\\n\\t\\t\"updatedFields\" : {\\n\\t\\t\\t\"field1\" : {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"left\" : old value,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"right\" : new value\\n\\t\\t\\t},\\n\\t\\t\\t\"field2\" : {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"left\" : old value,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"right\" : new value\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n} The following wiki explains the design of this POC',\n",

All the payload should be properly formatted and should work using Try it from documentation itself. Add the read only fields in the default response to mention them as Read only fields, e.g id, dateCreated, lastUpdated etc. It is read only field. Mention the behaviour of the field in case the value is not provided in the payload for update flows. e.g Not providing a field at all in the payload vs providing empty or null value in that field during update. Update the 403 error message in the documentation Forbidden (The server understood the request but refuses to authorise it). Add the following Note in the API description During an update request, only the fields provided in the payload will be updated. Any field not included in the payload will retain its previous value.

By leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for intelligent matching between parsed OCR data from PDF invoices and PO line items, the system will provide advanced tools for side-by-side comparison, user-driven corrections, and enhanced visibility into matching accuracy. Key features include enabling or disabling the PO matching feature at the supplier level, seamless integration of LLM matching logic, user-driven corrections, and dynamic visual indicators for matched, partially matched, and unmatched items. This epic also paves the way for future enhancements, such as leveraging flagged feedback to improve LLM accuracy over time, integrating AI learning loops, and introducing global configuration settings for matching logic. Planned User Stories for this Epic: Add a toggle in the supplier records to enable or disable the PO line item matching feature. Define the data integration process for sending parsed OCR and PO data to the LLM and receiving matching results. Implement a side-by-side comparison view for parsed OCR data and matched PO line items with editing and relinking capabilities. Provide an option to revert to the old system behavior for PO line-item handling. Allow users to flag matched line items as correct or incorrect for future reference and system improvement. Introduce visual indicators to identify perfect matches, partial matches, and unmatched items in invoices and side-by-side comparison views. Future Enhancements Under This Epic: AI-driven suggestions for unmatched or partially matched items based on historical data. Enhanced reporting and analytics for flagged items to track LLM performance. Allow bulk corrections for flagged incorrect matches. Introduce confidence scoring for LLM matching and user review prioritization. Develop customizable matching rules for specific suppliers or document types. This epic will streamline the PO matching process, reduce manual effort, and improve overall accuracy, significantly enhancing AP automation capabilities.',\n",

As a system  Admin , I need a backend feature toggle to control whether the new PO line item matching features (including supplier-level toggles, LLM-based matching, side-by-side mapping, flagging, and visual indicators) are enabled or disabled for a specific client.

Users who are allowed to create AP documents, namely, AP Processors, Managers, and Admins, and Users who are allowed to view / edit AP documents. How should this feature work? Feature Toggle Implementation: Introduce a  new  backend feature toggle labeled  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW__PO_LINE_ITEM_MATCHING . ( Open to shorter or different toggle name ) Default value for the toggle should be  OFF . Preference Setting Toggle: Once the backend feature toggle is turned ON, a new preference setting toggle labeled  \"Enable PO Line Item Matching\"  should appear under Vroozi Intelligence section. Tooltip text -  “Enable advanced PO line-item matching using AI-powered data processing. This feature compares parsed invoice data with PO line items to improve matching accuracy and provides tools for side-by-side comparison, mapping, and match status visualization. ”. The preference toggle should allow Admin users to control whether the PO line-item matching features are applied to documents within the client’s environment. Default value for the preference toggle should be OFF, even if the backend feature toggle is ON. Behavior When Toggle is OFF: The system retains its existing behavior without introducing any changes related to PO line item matching. Documents follow the standard flow, using PO line items directly if the PO number is captured. No changes to the supplier records or UI for side-by-side comparison or flagging features. Behavior When Toggle is ON: All features developed under the new PO line item matching process should be activated, including: Supplier-level toggle for enabling/disabling PO line item matching. Integration with LLM for data matching between PDF parsed items and PO line items. Side-by-side comparison and editable mapping for OCR data and PO line items. Revert-to-old-behavior option for specific documents. Line item flagging as correct/incorrect. Visual indicators for match statuses (perfect, partial, no match). Many more to come. Testing Requirements: Test all scenarios with the toggle  ON  to ensure new features are functioning correctly. Test with the toggle  OFF  to confirm the system reverts to the original behavior without any impact on existing functionality. Test scenarios where the feature toggle  does not exist  for a client: The system should behave as if the toggle is  OFF , retaining the existing behavior without any changes.

       "      'description': \"Requirements: This feature introduces a configurable threshold setting within company settings that determines the minimum confidence level needed for the system to auto-fill predicted values for various accounting fields on an invoice. Admins can specify different confidence thresholds for each accounting object, such as company code or GL account, allowing for tailored auto-fill behavior based on prediction confidence. The system will use these thresholds to determine whether to populate fields automatically during invoice creation, enhancing the accuracy and control over automated data entry. Acceptance Criteria: Introduce Configurable Prediction Thresholds in Company Settings : A new configuration option should be available in smart coding related objects in the company settings, allowing admins to set custom confidence thresholds for each accounting object that the smart coding model can predict. Example: predictionAutoFillThreshold {     companyCode: 0.7,     glAccount: 0.9,     … } Auto-fill Accounting Predictions Based on Confidence Thresholds : When creating an invoice, the system should apply the configured thresholds to auto-fill predictions into the corresponding accounting fields.  If the model's confidence for a given accounting object prediction meets or exceeds the set threshold, the system will auto-populate that accounting field in the invoice line. If the model's prediction confidence is below the configured threshold, the system will not auto-populate the accounting field in the invoice line.\",\n",

Identify how to change the limit if any. (DEV) Identify if the pre and post images are stored in the database as well apart from being written to kafka topics. If YES identify a way to delete these images from the database once they are used for auditing. Identify If connector is down, Does DB retains data, if yes for how much time Performance testing of pre and post audit of company setting update (QA) Identify what will happen in the case of error, does the connector break? Results: A new Rundeck job will be created which will be checking the status of the service and restart in case of failed status. The size is of 1mb which is enough for company settings since there is no document present in production db greater than 100kb. Fine tuning might be required in case we proceed with other collections.  These images are stored in a separate collection  config.system.preimages  and are automatically deleted along with entries from the op_log When the connector is restarted it picks up its lag and audit are the previous entries as well as long as they are available in op_log, if the connector is down for so long that op_log is cleared the entries are gone for good.

Acceptance Criteria: Cost Center Bulk Upsert POST API: Another API should be built that allows the user to get the status of the  Cost Center Bulk Upsert POST API  by providing the tracking number. The type of the API should be  GET . If the API does not return the status of the  Cost Center Bulk Upsert POST API  does not return the status, the system should return the error with details. This  Cost Center Bulk Upsert Status GET API  should return the following statuses of the  Cost Center Bulk Upsert POST API: If all the Cost Centers are created/updated successfully, the header level response status should be  COMPLETED. Each Object status should be  SUCCESS. If some or all Cost Centers are still being created or updated, the header level status should be  IN PROGRESS. Each Object status should be  SUCCESS/IN PROGRESS/ERROR  accordingly. If all of the Cost Centers are processed and some or all of them have validation errors, the status should be  COMPLETED WITH ERRORS. Each Object status should be  SUCCESS/ERROR  accordingly. If all the Cost Centers are processing failed due to some technical error (e.g. time out) that can be fixed by retrying, the status should be  FAILURE. Each Object status should be  FAILED If some of the Cost Centers are processing failed due to some technical error (e.g. time out) that can be fixed by retrying and some are processed successfully without any error, the status should be  COMPLETED WITH FAILURE. Each Object status should be  SUCCESS/FAILED  accordingly. This  Cost Center Bulk Upsert Status GET API  should return the count of: Total items Items successfully uploaded Items failed(due to failure or validation error) The  Cost Center Bulk Upsert Status GET API  should return the state of each Cost Center in the API payload: The status should be  In Progress  if the Cost Center is still in Progress. The status should be  Success  if the Cost Center is created successfully. The status should be  Error  if the Cost Center is not created due to: Validation Error Duplication Failure (time out etc) The response should also contain the details of each error type according to the set pattern of showcasing the error details. Documentation: There should be two new entries in the API Documentation in the  Cost Center  sub-menu of the  Master Data  menu Those two entries should be for the following APIs: Cost Center Bulk Upsert POST API ( please use the naming convention as per standards ) The API summary( appears next to the API endpoint ) should be ‘ Create or Update the Cost Center s  in bulk asynchronously’ .

       "      'description': \"This ticket was split from   , on 10/21/2024 at the dev team’s request, to simplify testing efforts. It is only meant to deal with the original tickets' requirements for making the cells in the first 2 columns of the table editable. See the section highlighted in  Red .  Business Case: As a standard feature, all users that log into a Parent unitID must be able to access a list of child unitIDs that they can navigate to, in order to conduct business. This should be available to Non-admin users in the Parent unitID by default, and to Admin users as an option (once we introduce the reporting dashboard for them).  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The unitID must be configured to work as a Parent unitID There must be at least 2 Child unitIDs connected to it.  The user logging in has access to child unitIDs and must be a Parent unitID user How should the user be able to get to this list of Child unitIDs? When the user logs into the Parent unitID, this is the screen they should land on.  If the user is on another screen in the Parent unitID, they should be able to navigate to this screen by clicking on the “Business Units” link in the left nav bar.  What should the user see on this screen when they land on it? The user should see a message at the top of the screen.  This message should read “ TBD “. The user should be able to dismiss this message by clicking on a “Close” button in the section containing the message.  However, this message should reappear when the user logs into the application again. While still logged in, if the user dismisses the message, there is no need to display it again, for the duration of that logged in session.  When the user navigatess back to the Parent unitID, from a child unitID, the system can once again display the message, unless the user had previously clocked on the “Don’t show again“ checkbox.  The user should be able to dismiss the message for good, by checking the “Don’t show again“ checkbox next to the “Close” button.  The user should see the page title as “Business Units“ The user should see a table below that, with the following columns:  Business Unit Description Last Accessed on Action The Business Unit column should list all the Child unitIDs linked to the current Parent unitID, that the logged in user has access to. By default, this list should display the values found in these Child unitID’s Company  → Profile → Company Name field.  The Description column should only display a value if the Parent unitID Admin provides a description for this Child unitID. Otherwise, the column can show an “n/a” for rows that do not have a description.  The Last Accessed on column should display the most recent date that the user navigated to that specific child unitID. This value should be updated by the system, every time the user navigates to that specific Child unitID.  The Action column should include icons for the following controls:  Edit The Edit icon should ONLY be available to the user if they have the Parent unitID Admin role assigned.  The Edit icon should be a pencil glyph Clicking on this should make the first 2 cells for that specific row editable. and change the pencil icon to a “save” icon (perhaps a “tick mark”).  The cell in the Business Unit column is mandatory. The user should not be able to save the row without providing some value in this cell. This cell CANNOT use the same value as another Child unitID that’s connected to the current Parent unitID. If the user enters such a value, the system should highlight the text input field with a red border, and display a red “!” icon in the input field; aligned to the right edge of the field. Hovering over this icon should display a tool-tip with the message “TBD“.  The cell in the Description column is optional. The user can save the row without providing a value in this field if they don’t want to.  Navigate to The Navigate to icon should be visible to all users that log into the Parent unitID and have access to that specific Child unitID.  The Navigate to icon should be a square with an arrow pointing up and to the right, out of it.  Clicking on this should navigate the user to that specific child unitID, in the same browser tab.  How many unitIDs will be listed in this table? There is no restriction at the moment, on how many child unitIDs can be linked to a parent unitID, or how many of those a single user can be given access to.  The table should list a maximum of 10 rows, after which it should paginate the data.\",\n",

       "      'description': 'Business Case: When a user belonging to a “Parent” unitID; as defined in   , logs into the system with their username & password, Vroozi needs a way to identify this user and upon authenticating them, must route them into the parent unitID, instead of a child unitID. Alternatively, if the user logging into the system is identified as NOT belonging to a parent unitID, they should be directed to the single child unitID that they belong to, as usual.  Why do this? Why don’t we just log the parent unitID’s user directly into the parent unitID, like we do for child unitID users? The reason we are adding this logic to the authentication process is because, in the future, we will want to allow Admins in the parent unitID to selectively “upgrade” a child unitID’s user to a parent unitID user. Whereby, when that upgraded user logs into Vroozi in the future, we will want to route them to the parent unitID, instead of the child unitID their user account was originally created in.  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The feature flag added in    should be enabled for this parent unitID.  There should be at least 1 child unitID linked to this parent unitID.  One or more users should exist in this parent unitID and be active.  One or more users should exist in the linked child unitID(s) and be active.  There should be a way to identify users with access to a parent unitID. This identifier could, in the futre, be used for reporting as well.  When the user enters their username/passwrod combination on the Vroozi login screen, and submits it to the BE service for processing, the system should fetch the user’s record from the DB based on the provided credentials.  From this user record, the system needs to determine if this user has access to the parent unitID, or to a child unitID. If the system determines that the user belongs to a parent unitID, then the user should be routed to the relevant parent unitID.  If the system determines that the user does not belong to a parent unitID, then the user should be routed to the appropriate child unitID that they belong to.   to create a separate ticket for this requirement below:   A user CANNOT exist in multiple child unitIDs without also belonging to a parent unitID.',\n",

This “Parent” will be used to view aggregrate reporting data against all the child unitIDs, and also wo provision user accounts for users that need to access multiple child unitIDs.

A single unitID cannot be the “Child” of multiple “Parent” unitIDs.  A unitID that is already flagged as a “Parent” unitID cannot be the “Child” unitID of another parent.  A unitID that is already a “Child” unitID and is linked to an eisting “Parent”, cannot be designated as a Parent unitID.  It should be possible for Vroozi to establish this link between parent/child unitIDs at both unitID creation time, as well as after the fact.

Note: When we edit a catalog, the child version of that catalog is added to the Working column. In this case, the system generates a new record in the catalog collection of database with a reference to the parent catalog. During this process, the system also creates data in the  catalog_item  collection against the child catalog reference. When the child version of the catalog is approved and then published, the system marks that child catalog version as soft deleted but hard deletes the child catalog associated catalog items. If the user doesn’t edit any catalog item that has associated Custom Fields, the system keeps references of these child associated items in those Custom Fields. It keeps adding and not removing invalid references.',\n",

Behavior for Non-SDM Suppliers : If the supplier record is not an SDM supplier, the  User_Groups  field is optional. Leaving the field blank or including User Group names will not result in errors. User Group data will not be saved for Non-SDM suppliers. Bulk Download : When Admins download the supplier bulk file: The  User_Groups  field should display all User Group names linked to each supplier record, separated by a delimiter (e.g., a comma).

       "      'description': 'Business Case : As an  Admin , I want to manage the  User Group  field in  User Bulk Upload  and  Download  templates to efficiently link a User Group with User records based on their roles. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  The  User Group  field will be integrated into the User Bulk Upload and Download templates for both PMAN and SDM. The field will follow specific validation rules and behavior depending on the user’s roles and the side (PMAN or SDM) from which the bulk upload is performed. The field will allow Admins to assign a single active and non-deleted User Group to a user when the user has an SDM role. The system will validate and process this field during uploads and populate it during downloads. Which customers should this change impact?  Customers using the SDM module (ex: NBCU). What pages should this change impact?   PMAN > Master Data > Users > User Bulk Upload, Download, & Template. SDM > Master Data > Users > User Bulk Upload, Download, & Template. Which users should be impacted by the change? Header in Templates : The column header for the User Group field in both PMAN and SDM templates should be named  User_Group  (case-sensitive). Single User Group : The  User_Group  column will allow only one User Group name per user record. The value must be the name of an active, non-deleted User Group. Behavior on PMAN Side : Mandatory Field : The  User_Group  field becomes mandatory if any of the following SDM roles are selected for a user: SDM Admin SDM Power User SDM Basic User Admin must provide an active, non-deleted User Group name in the  User_Group  column for these users. Optional Field : If no SDM roles are selected for a user, the  User_Group  field becomes optional: Leaving it empty will not generate errors. Adding a value will not save the User Group to the user record since Non-SDM users do not require User Groups. Behavior on SDM Side : Always Mandatory : On the SDM side, users are expected to have SDM roles by default. The  User_Group  field is always mandatory in the bulk upload template. Admins must provide an active, non-deleted User Group name in the  User_Group  column. Error Handling in Bulk Upload : If the  User_Group  field is empty or contains an invalid value (non-existent, deleted, or inactive User Group), the system should: Use the existing error messaging style in the generated error report. Bulk Download : When Admins download the user bulk file: The  User_Group  field should display the name of the User Group linked to each SDM user’s record. For Non-SDM users, the  User_Group  field should remain blank. Validation Rules : The system must validate the  User_Group  field during the bulk upload process to ensure: The User Group exists. The User Group is active and not deleted. The field is populated for SDM users when required. UI and Experience : Ensure consistency between PMAN and SDM templates for field naming and behavior. Display clear error messages in the error report for missing or invalid  User_Group  data. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  Purchase Team.

Dropdown Behavior : The  User Group  field will function as a  searchable text input with dropdown results , similar to the  Content Group  field. Admins can start typing a User Group name, and the dropdown will display matching results in real-time. If no matches are found, the dropdown will show no results. Behavior Based on Role (PMAN Side) : The  User Group  field should be visible and mandatory when one of the following SDM roles is selected: SDM Admin SDM Power User SDM Basic User If none of these roles are selected, the  User Group  field should not appear in the profile.

Previously, some\\nusers experienced slower processing times when updating catalogs particularly when\\nthere were a significant number of catalog versions. We overhauled our processing\\nlogic to ensure more efficient handling of catalog updates. With this change, our\\ntesting showed faster, more consistent, and more reliable performance no matter how\\nmany catalog versions were in the system.\\n- Time Savings: Customers will get significantly reduced processing times, even for\\n      heavily updated catalogs.\\n- Consistency: The system will exhibit reliable performance regardless of how\\n      many catalog versions.\\n- Scalability: Customers will be able to handle frequent updates without worrying\\n      about diminishing system efficiency.\\n\\nThis enhancement will be available to all customers. No configuration change is\\nrequired.\\n# Resolutions\\n- The unread notification count on the bell icon (bottom left corner of the left\\n      navigation column) will now update automatically. The notification count will\\n      now update dynamically as new notifications arrive, ensuring accurate and\\n      real-time badge counts. No need to refresh the browser to update the count.\\n- Resolved an issue on the shopping cart screen where the Move to Request\\n      button remained enabled during processing, allowing multiple clicks and\\n      causing duplicate purchase requests. The button is now disabled after the\\n      request click until the operation is complete, preventing duplicates.\\n- Fixed an issue where updating the shipping address at the Purchase Request\\n      (PR) document level did not propagate the change to individual line items. The\\n      system now correctly replicates the updated address across all line items in the\\n      PR.\\n- The system now consistently removes leading zeroes on the UI as per the\\n   configuration to hide leading zeros, while retaining the leading zeros in the\\n   database.'},\n",

       "      'description': 'Goal Improve UI/UX related to similar items navigation Current Issues Partially Hidden Items:  Depending on screen size, the last item in the carousel was often partially or fully hidden. The layout has been adjusted so that all items are now fully visible. Inconsistent Scrolling:  The scrolling behavior of the carousel was inconsistent. Users had to click multiple times to reveal items, and sometimes the scrolling would only move a small amount. This has been resolved to provide smooth and predictable scrolling with a single click. Suggested Enhancements: Dynamic Card Display:  The number of item cards displayed in the carousel now dynamically adjusts based on screen size. This ensures optimal use of screen space and displays up to five items on larger screens. Hover-to-Show Navigation:  Navigation icons are hidden by default and only appear when the user hovers over the \"Similar Items\" area. When hovering near the edge, the icon changes to an arrow, and upon clicking, the carousel smoothly navigates to the next item with a single click. Mobile Device Improvements: Smaller navigation icons have been implemented for better usability on smaller screens. Touch-enabled scrolling (drag and drop) has been added for touch devices, as hovering is not applicable. Video Recording',\n",

At least 2 users have been created: 2.1. One user with both  Financial Approver  and  Sourcing Approver  roles (e.g., ABC user). 2.2. Another user with only the  Sourcing Approver  role (e.g., XYZ user). Set the ABC user as the  Fallback Approver  as well as the  Alternate Approver  for the XYZ user. Enable the  Financial Workflow  and  Sourcing Workflow . Create and configure a  Sourcing Rule  with the XYZ user, with an amount limit of $50. Set the employee spend limit (e.g., $100). Create and submit a  Purchase Request  that exceeds the requester's spend limit and qualifies for  Sourcing Review . Ensure the system shows two approvers: one  Sourcing Approver  and one  Financial Approver . Steps to Reproduce: Log in to PMAN as the  Alternate Approver  user (ABC user). Load the above  Purchase Request  and approve it. Verify the  Purchase Request  status and  Approval Status History . Actual Result: The system shows the  Purchase Request  in  Financial Review  status, and the  Approval Status  indicates that it is approved by all users. Re-approve by (ABC user) in the role of Financial Approver. Actual Result: The system throws an error while re-approving the Purchase Request. Expected Result: The system should move the  Purchase Request  to  Approved  status once all eligible approvers have approved it. Note:   Actually, the client configured the Enhanced Workflow, but this issue exists in both cases, whether the Enhanced Financial Workflow is enabled or disabled.\",\n",

       "      'description': 'Business Case: The previous implementation of the User Bulk upload and download functionality did not account for differing access controls between PMAN Admins and User Group Admins. With updated requirements, User Group Admins are restricted to managing users in their own User Group, while PMAN Admins retain full access. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? PMAN Admins can download all users across all User Groups and upload or update users with any valid User Group without restrictions. User Group Admins can only download users linked to their User Group and are restricted to uploading or updating users within their assigned User Group, with errors thrown for unauthorized User Groups. If the Project (Production) setting is turned OFF for a User Group, Project (Production) data is excluded from the download file and not required or validated during upload. Locations must belong to the supplier and the User Group, with errors thrown for invalid locations. Additionally, if Enable EF Access is turned OFF for a User Group, assigning the SUPPLIER_DISCOVERY_EF_APPROVER role will result in an error. Which customers should this change impact?  Customers using the SDM module (ex: NBCU). What pages should this change impact? SDM > Master Data > Users > User Bulk Upload, and Download. Which users should be impacted by the change? PMAN Admin SDM Admin Example: Redbook Admin (User Group 1 = Redbook) Example: Directory Admin (User Group 2 = Directory) How should this feature work? PMAN Admin Behavior User Download File: PMAN Admins can download all users, regardless of User Group association. The  User_Group  field in the download file will display the User Group linked to each user. User Upload File: PMAN Admins can create new users or update existing users with any valid User Group. No restrictions on assigning a User Group in the  User_Group  field. User Group Admin Behavior User Download File: User Group Admins (Redbook Admin / Directory Admin) can only download users linked to their own User Group. Users outside their User Group will not appear in the file. User Upload File: User Group Admins can only create or update users linked to their own User Group. Validation : If the  User_Group  field contains a User Group not associated with the User Group Admin, the system throws an error and prevents creation/update (use existing error messaging template). User Upload Behavior (PMAN and User Group Admins) Project (Production): If turned OFF for a User Group, Project (Production) data is not validated or required during upload for users in that group. Location Validation: For all User Groups, the Location must belong to the supplier and the User Group. If an invalid location is provided, the system throws an error (use existing error messaging template). SUPPLIER_DISCOVERY_EF_APPROVER Role Validation: If  Enable EF Access  is OFF for a User Group, assigning the  SUPPLIER_DISCOVERY_EF_APPROVER  role will result in an error (use existing error messaging template).

       "      'description': 'Business Case: Previously, the Supplier Bulk upload and download functionality was developed assuming uniform access for all Admins. However, with updated requirements,  PMAN Admins  have  full access  across all User Groups, while  User Group Admins  (e.g., Redbook, Directory) have  restricted access  to suppliers based on their User Group. These restrictions must be reflected in the Supplier Bulk upload and download functionality to maintain consistency and proper access control. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? PMAN Admins: Can download all supplier data with User Groups displayed in the  User_Group  field (separated by a delimiter or blank if no User Groups are linked). No changes to their Supplier Bulk upload behavior; they can create or update suppliers with one or more valid User Groups. User Group Admins (Redbook/Directory): Can only download suppliers linked to their User Group. Can only create new suppliers linked to their User Group in the  User_Group  field. Cannot modify suppliers linked to multiple User Groups or suppliers outside their User Group. Errors are thrown for unauthorized User Group changes during upload. Which customers should this change impact?  Customers using the SDM module (ex: NBCU). What pages should this change impact? SDM > Master Data > Suppliers > Supplier Bulk Upload, and Download. Which users should be impacted by the change? PMAN Admin SDM Admin Example: Redbook Admin (User Group 1 = Redbook) Example: Directory Admin (User Group 2 = Directory) How should this feature work? PMAN Admin Behavior Supplier Download: PMAN Admins can download all suppliers, regardless of User Group association. The  User_Group  field shows all linked User Groups separated by a delimiter or blank if no User Groups are linked. Supplier Upload: PMAN Admins can create or update SDM Suppliers with one or more valid User Groups in the  User_Group  field. Behavior for Non-SDM Suppliers remains unchanged. User Group Admin Behavior Supplier Download: User Group Admins  can only download suppliers linked to their User Group. If a supplier belongs to  multiple  User Groups (e.g., Redbook and Directory): The supplier will appear in the file for both Redbook Admin and Directory Admin. The  User_Group  field will show all linked User Groups (e.g., Redbook, Directory). Suppliers  not linked  to the User Group Admin\\'s User Group are excluded. Supplier Upload: User Group Admins can only create or update suppliers linked to their User Group. Validation: If the  User_Group  field contains a User Group the Admin is not associated with, the system should throw an error and prevent creation. Error Example: \"Unauthorized User Group [Directory] specified. You can only create suppliers for your assigned User Group [Redbook].\" Multi-User Group suppliers: User Group Admins cannot modify supplier records linked to multiple User Groups. Any changes made to this supplier by the User Group Admin during the upload process will be  ignored .

Once the User Group is selected, dynamic behavior must apply to reflect settings such as SDM Label, Project (Production), Enable EF Access, and SDM Locations for the selected User Group. This approach aligns with the logic implemented for the SDM User modal, with slight differences in workflow prioritization. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? Maintain existing behavior on the PMAN user modal where the  User Group  field only appears after the PMAN Admin selects an SDM role in the  Access  section. Display the  Default Setting SDM Label  (e.g., \"Supplier Discovery Admin\") to the PMAN Admin by default, regardless of whether an SDM role is selected.

Existing Behavior (Current Implementation -    ) PMAN Admin must select an SDM role (e.g., SDM Admin, SDM Power User, etc.) first. After selecting the SDM role, the  User Group  field appears as a mandatory field in the  Access  section. Dynamic Updates After SDM Role and User Group Selection: Once the PMAN Admin selects an SDM role: The  User Group  field appears as a mandatory field. The PMAN Admin selects a User Group (e.g., Redbook, Directory). Based on the selected User Group, the following dynamic updates apply: SDM Label:  Updates to reflect the User Group\\'s SDM Label (e.g., \"Redbook Admin,\" \"Directory Basic User\"). Project (Production): If turned OFF for the selected User Group, Project (Production) fields are hidden in the user modal. Enable EF Access: If turned OFF for the selected User Group, EF-related sub-roles (e.g., EF Approval) are hidden in the user modal.

Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? PMAN Admins  can view, create, edit, and delete all suppliers across all User Groups.

PMAN Admin Behavior: PMAN Admins  can view, create, edit, and delete all suppliers in  Master Data > Suppliers , regardless of User Group associations. For new suppliers: Default Behavior:  The  Default Setting SDM Label  is displayed initially. If the PMAN Admin selects  User Group A (Redbook) , the system updates the SDM Label dynamically to the  User Group A SDM Label . If the PMAN Admin selects  User Group B (Directory) , the system updates the SDM Label dynamically to the  User Group B SDM Label . If multiple User Groups (e.g., Redbook and Directory) are selected, the system reverts to the  Default Setting SDM Label  for simplicity. Example Scenarios: Scenario 1:  SDM toggle OFF → SDM Label shows \"Default Label.\" Scenario 2:  SDM toggle ON but no User Group selected → SDM Label shows \"Default Label.\" Scenario 3:  Redbook selected → SDM Label updates to \"Redbook Label.\" Scenario 4:  Redbook + Directory selected → SDM Label reverts to \"Default Label.\" PMAN Admins can link one or multiple User Groups to a supplier. User Group Admin Behavior: User Group Admins  (e.g.,  Redbook Admin ,  Directory Admin ) can view, create, and edit suppliers linked only to their respective User Group. When a User Group Admin creates a new supplier: The system automatically links the supplier to their User Group (e.g., Redbook Admin links the supplier to Redbook). The SDM Label dynamically updates to the  User Group SDM Label  (e.g., Redbook Label). The  User Group field  is hidden from the User Group Admin\\'s view. User Group Admins cannot view or edit suppliers linked to other User Groups. Multi-User Group Linked Supplier Behavior: If a supplier is linked to  multiple  User Groups (e.g.,  Redbook  and  Directory ): Both User Group Admins can view the supplier in  Master Data > Suppliers . The delete icon and activate/deactivate checkbox for such suppliers are disabled. Replace the  delete icon  with a tooltip: Tooltip:  \"This supplier cannot be deleted or deactivated as it is shared across multiple User Groups.

       "      'summary': 'SDM: SDM settings should be configurable based on User Groups.',\n",
       "      'description': 'Business Case: Today, SDM settings are common for all users. To improve flexibility and control, the settings need to be configurable based on User Groups. PMAN Admin should have full access to manage Default settings and User Group settings, while User Group Admins (e.g., Redbook and Directory) can only manage settings related to their assigned User Group. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? Implement a typeahead dropdown in the SDM settings to switch between Default and User Group-specific settings. Configure SDM settings to allow PMAN Admins to manage Default and User Group-specific settings, while User Group Admins manage only their assigned settings. Which customers should this change impact?  Customers using the SDM module (ex: NBCU). What pages should this change impact? SDM > Settings page. Which users should be impacted by the change? PMAN Admin SDM Admin Example: Redbook Admin (User Group 1 = Redbook) Example: Directory Admin (User Group 2 = Directory) How should this feature work? Add User Group Dropdown Add a typeahead dropdown field “ User Group ” in the SDM Settings to select between  Default  and  User Group-specific  settings. Default User Group Functionality The  Default User Group  serves as the company-wide settings, preserving the current system view and functionality for PMAN Admins who are not tied to specific User Groups. The  Default User Group  is not a record in  Master Data > User Groups  but exists as a system-managed baseline for default settings. Settings Navigation When a  PMAN Admin  navigates to the Settings section, the  Default  option should be pre-selected in the User Group dropdown. PMAN Admins  can: Change the selection to view or manage other User Groups\\' settings. Select Default settings or a specific User Group to view and manage its settings. Customize settings for any User Group. User Group Admins  can only: Manage their assigned User Group settings. Customize settings for their assigned User Group. Example : User Group 1 = Redbook Redbook Admin can only view/edit Redbook settings. User Group 2 = Directory Directory Admin can only view/edit Directory settings. New User Group Creation When a new User Group is created in  Master Data > Users > User Group , the system automatically inherits all  Default settings  into the new User Group’s settings. Changes made to  Default settings  after a User Group is created  do not impact  existing User Group settings. Customizable Fields All other fields in the settings, such as Email Body, Email Subject, Company Logo, Login Page Background, Sourcing Emails, etc., can be customized to suit each User Group\\'s specific needs after the Default settings have been inherited. Exceptions SSO Button Link / SSO Login Button Link Behavior: PMAN Admins  can update these fields in any User Group settings, including the Default User Group. Changes made to these fields in any User Group settings (Default or specific) automatically  propagate  across all User Group settings. For  User Group Admins , these fields are  read-only  and  cannot  be edited. Notes : SSO Button Link  is available in  Email Settings  for both  Module Type = Purchasing Manager  and  Supplier Discovery  under  Email Type = Welcome Mail . SSO Login Button Link  is available under  Company Settings . Login Page URL Pattern:   Auto-populated with the  User Group name  (spaces replaced with hyphens “-”) upon User Group creation. This field can be customized for each User Group after creation. Default settings  will include a Login Page URL Pattern (\"Supplier-Discovery\") for new clients, editable by PMAN Admin. Note :  For  NBCU , the  Redbook User Group  may need to be created, and the  Default setting\\'s Login Page URL Pattern  manually updated to distinguish between the Default and Redbook URLs. Login Process: The system should allow a user to log in using any valid  Login Page URL Pattern  as long as their credentials are correct. The  Login Page URL Pattern  itself should not restrict login for users associated with other User Groups. Example : A Redbook user logging in via the Directory URL should still be authenticated based on their credentials. Post-Login Behavior: Once logged in, users should see the views, settings, and data appropriate for their User Group based on their user profile. Example : A Redbook user will only see Redbook-specific views and settings, even if they logged in via a Directory URL. Supplier Discovery Label: Auto-filled with the User Group name upon User Group creation. This field can also be customized for each User Group after creation. Add new Tooltips : SSO Button Link: URL for the Single Sign-On button, updated across all User Groups when modified. SSO Login Button Link: URL for the Single Sign-On login button, updated across all User Groups when modified. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Maybe. Would this change impact existing documents?  Maybe. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  Purchase Team. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date Can we make the login button editable on all user groups including the default user group for PMAN Admins so that they can make changes to this field from any screen possible? But we would need to add a tool tip for added context as well as keep the field read-only for SDM Admins for their user groups. Yes, PMAN Admins can edit the SSO Button Link and SSO Login Button Link fields from any User Group settings screen, including Default. Changes made on any screen will propagate across all User Groups. These fields will remain read-only for SDM Admins. The ticket description has been updated to include this clarification along with tooltips for context.   1/21/2025   1/21/2025 Can you please add in the ticket that the login process also needs to be handled in this ticket itself for login page URL? Also, do we need to validate the User Groups with the credentials at the time of login? I’ve updated the description to include handling the login process using the Login Page URL Pattern. The system will validate credentials during login but will not restrict access based on the URL used. Once logged in, users will see views and settings based on their User Group association.   1/21/2025   1/22/2025 Should we add a new error message if the user is trying to log into SDM using the wrong User Group Link? No, an error message is not required since the system will validate credentials regardless of the User Group Link used, and users will see their appropriate views post-login.   1/21/2025   1/22/2025 Can you please clarify in the ticket on how the Default User Group is supposed to function or what its role is? I\\'ve updated the description of the ticket to clarify the role and functionality of the Default User Group, ensuring its purpose and behavior are clearly defined.   1/21/2025   1/22/2025 # Question Recommendation Response Remarks \\xa0 For now, the quick way to handle the login process would be that any SDM login URL can be used for now in order for the user to log in to the system. We would not do a URL + User Group check to see if the right person is logging into their profile. This can be done in the future but removing the requirement from the ticket itself will help expedite the solution for this project.  I have considered this solution and updated the Acceptance Criteria accordingly to reflect that any SDM login URL can be used for login without a URL + User Group check. Post-login behavior will align with the user\\'s User Group settings.',\n",

Which customers should this change impact?  Customers who have  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW  = true, Client  subscribed  to Supplier Portal and Supplier has  Supplier Portal toggle  = ON. What pages should this change impact?  Master Data > Suppliers. Which users should be impacted by the change? Admins. How should this feature work? Key Features : The \" Allow Dispute Invoice via Supplier Portal \" toggle appears only for suppliers with Supplier Portal access ( Allow Access to Supplier Portal  toggle = ON) and at least one user is set up & active. This toggle should be available in  Basic Info  Tab. The toggle is OFF by  default . Tooltip : \"Enable this to allow invoice disputes for this supplier via Supplier Portal.\" Turning the toggle ON allows AP users to dispute invoices with the supplier via the Supplier Portal. Turning this toggle ON or OFF should be tracked in the  Supplier   Change History . Adding this toggle to the Supplier Bulk upload is Out of Scope for this ticket.

The middleware is doing so using the  /purchase-orders/submit  endpoint to submit an existing Purchase Order along with the external Id. It appears that the  /purchase-orders/submit  endpoint is not storing the external ID when posting the Purchase Order information with the external ID instead it is trying to create a new Purchase Order. Steps to reproduce: Fetch an existing Purchase Order using the  /purchase-orders/{id} endpoint and utilize the response and submit a Request to  /purchase-orders/submit  including the data in the externalId field. Current Result:  The API is creating another Purchase Order. Expected Result: The API should update the existing Purchase Order and populate the externalId field.',\n",

Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? As a  Supplier Portal user , I want to be able to see invoices that are in  Disputed  and  Voided  status on the Invoices page, So that I can track and manage invoices that require my attention. Which customers should this change impact? Customers who have  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW  = true, and  Dispute Invoice via Supplier Portal  toggle = ON. What pages should this change impact? Supplier Portal > Invoices page Which users should be impacted by the change? SP User. How should this feature work? The  Invoices page  in the Supplier Portal should display invoices with the following statuses: Disputed Voided The  Status Filter  on the Invoices page should include the following options: Disputed Voided All other existing invoice statuses When a Supplier Portal user selects  Disputed  from the Status Filter, only invoices marked as  Disputed  should be displayed. When a Supplier Portal user selects  Voided  from the Status Filter, only invoices marked as  Voided  should be displayed.

This ensures that I am not exposed to incomplete or non-functional features and reduces potential confusion or frustration. Acceptance Criteria : Initial State (Feature Hidden): Users should not see any Invoice Dispute Process-related UI elements or functionalities. Feature Toggle Implementation: Introduce a temporary feature toggle (e.g.,  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW__INVOICE_DISPUTE ) to control the visibility of the Invoice Dispute Process features. When the toggle is  off , the Invoice Dispute Process features remain hidden. When the toggle is  on , all developed Invoice Dispute Process features become visible and usable by all users. Toggle Removal Post-Completion: Once the Invoice Dispute Process feature is completely developed for Supplier Portal clients, remove the temporary feature toggle and ensure the feature is permanently visible to the users. Testing & Verification: Verify that toggling the switch on/off reliably hides and shows the Invoice Dispute Process features. Ensure no partial or placeholder elements are visible when the toggle is off.',\n",

( Future - not part of this ticket, but for reference ) If the invoice can only be disputed via email, it should be pre-selected and cannot be changed by the AP user. Recipient : For Supplier Portal (SP) Invoices: If an SP invoice is disputed, the dispute is assigned to the SP user who created and sent the invoice, as long as they are still active. Example :   Adam creates SP Invoice 90000056789. If disputed, the dispute goes to Adam if he\\'s still active. If the original SP user is inactive, the AP user can select another SP user from a list of all SP users linked to the supplier. (   to check what the current system behavior is on who can see the invoice and accordingly decide Administrator or Order Processor should be allowed to take the action. ) Example :   If Adam is inactive, the AP user can assign the dispute to another SP user, like Ryan. If no SP users are active for the supplier, the invoice cannot be disputed via the Supplier Portal. For Non-SP Invoices (Email, OCR, cXML, API) and Manually Created Invoices  (Will confirm with internal stakeholders regarding disputes for manual invoices) : If disputed, the AP user can assign the dispute to an SP user from a list of SP users linked to the supplier. Example :   Matthew sends Invoice 90000056452 via email. If disputed, the AP user can assign it to Adam, Matthew, or Ryan. If no SP users are active for the supplier, the invoice cannot be disputed. Future Consideration: Support for notifying multiple or all SP users linked to the supplier for disputes may be added later.

This causes confusion, as the displayed role does not accurately reflect the user’s group-based designation. To enhance clarity, the system should update the  Role  column in the  Users Grid  to reflect the  correct role label  based on the  user\\'s assigned user group  instead of the default group setting. Note :    We had briefly discussed this back during the Phase 2 implementation. I believe this can be done more efficiently with fewer API calls, but we didn’t pursue it at the time due to the tight deadline for completing the MVP project. Here is comment for reference -   and     Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? As a  PMAN Admin , I want to see the  correct role labels  in the  User Grid  of  SDM > Master Data > Users  and  PMAN > Master Data > Users , So that I can accurately identify users based on their  actual assigned user group  rather than a default setting. Which customers should this change impact?  Customers using the SDM module (ex: NBCU). What pages should this change impact? PMAN > Master Data > Users. SDM > Master Data > Users. Which users should be impacted by the change? PMAN Admin. How should this feature work? Role Label Updates Based on User Group: The  Role  column in the  Users Grid  should reflect the  correct user group label  configured for each user, rather than using the  Default User Group  setting. Example -  If a user belongs to the  Redbook  user group, their role should be displayed as: Redbook Admin Redbook Power User Redbook Basic User Example - If a user belongs to the  Directory  user group, their role should be displayed as: Directory Admin Directory Power User Directory Basic User This applies to  both  the  SDM  and  PMAN User Grid  views. PMAN Admins See the Correct Labels for Users from Different User Groups: Instead of seeing all users under a  single default group label  (e.g., \"Discovery Power User\" for all users), PMAN Admins should see: John as a Redbook Power User Matt as a Directory Power User Other users based on their user group labels Retain Existing Labeling for Redbook and Directory Admins: Redbook Admins should continue to see only Redbook users with the appropriate  Redbook  role labels. Directory Admins should continue to see only Directory users with the appropriate  Directory  role labels. No change in behavior for these user groups.

Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? The Supplier Information UI will dynamically adjust when Custom fields are added to different sections (Supplier Details, Business Information, Contract Information, Insurance Information).

No, we do not need to connect to the service at the time of configuration, we need to store this information properly. 3 Need to have the gateway or connector API as well No, we do not need a way to communicate to external system during configuration, this is already done during the actual invocation of the service. 4 IF there is no endpoint from the external system to validate credentials without the actual payload. 5 Do we need to add the type of the service as well? Yes, I think it should be to make this configuration generic. 6 Can you please confirm the expected behavior for the  url  field? Should the system allow storing plain text if no valid URL is provided, or should it strictly enforce a proper URL format?     It should be URL only field.',\n",

With client interest growing, we need to ensure our integration meets Avalara’s latest connection guidelines and security requirements. So, the objective of this R&D initiative is to: Assess the current integration to determine its compatibility with Avalara’s latest API and security standards. Identify required upgrades to meet the new connection guidelines and ensure a stable, production-ready integration. Document findings and provide recommendations for implementation. Scope Review the existing Avalara integration. Compare against Avalara’s latest API and integration guidelines. Identify deprecated endpoints, authentication changes, and compliance needs. Test the existing integration using sandbox/production credentials and validate actual features. Document findings and provide recommendations for upgrades. Research & Approach Review Avalara’s latest API documentation to check for changes, deprecations, and security updates. Assess authentication and security to ensure compliance with Avalara’s policies. Test the existing sandbox integration to identify failures, performance issues, and API updates required. Compare sandbox vs. production requirements to ensure a seamless upgrade. Document findings and risks, including code changes, potential challenges, and mitigation strategies. Acceptance Criteria Technical Assessment Report:  Current state analysis, compatibility gaps, and required updates. Upgrade Roadmap:  Action plan with development and testing estimates. Test Plan:  Steps for validating the upgraded integration.',\n",

Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system takes the settings to include or exclude Shipping Charges and Tax on the Company → Workflow page and routes to the appropriate Approvers for approval. 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true  and  the new workflow rules feature toggle = true. Important Notes:   The new workflow enhancements will only be enabled for Maersk initially. For all other customers for whom this will be turned off, the existing functionality will prevail (for both Vroozi Invoice and Purchase). 3.  What pages should this change impact?  The documents themselves, when they are routed for approval. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Approvers. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. A document is ready to be submitted for approval  or  is already in the approval chain, manually or to be auto-submitted by the system. Exclude Tax Exclude Tax = On: The system excludes Tax from the workflow determination, that is, the system subtracts Tax from the Document Total. Exclude Tax = Off: The system includes Tax from the workflow determination, that is, the system does  not  subtract Tax from the Document Total. Exclude Shipping Charges Exclude Shipping = On: The system excludes Shipping from the workflow determination, that is, the system subtracts Shipping from the Document Total. Exclude Shipping = Off: The system includes Shipping from the workflow determination, that is, the system does  not  subtract Shipping from the Document Total. Approval Determination The system uses the finally computed Total to determine which Approvers should approve the document with everything else being the same. 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Potentially yes. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  In general, yes. But, existing documents for Maersk will not be impacted as they have turned these settings off, that is, Tax and Shipping are included by default for workflow determination. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams.

At every event, e.g. approve, submit, etc,. the approvals routing will be determined based on the latest settings. This is current state and it makes sense. None. 2 How should we handle the Withholding Tax and Use Tax scenarios? Do we need to add separate toggles? Both should be included or excluded. Both of these constitute the Total Tax being paid out by AP. Most customers will want both PR and invoice approval to mimic each other. 3 How should we handle Special Handling charges? Special Handling is inserted into the Shipping Charges. It will be included or excluded based on the Shipping Charges setting. There is no way to differentiate this scenario.

The system showcases Purchasing Organization field and all of its associated messages only if this new feature toggle is enabled; otherwise, it is  not . 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true (and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, if memos are enabled). Note:  The feature toggle is applied to both invoices and memos alike. 3.  What pages should this change impact?  The invoice and memos pages. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?   Users who are allowed to create AP documents, namely, AP Processors, Managers, and Admins, will be able to update the Purchasing Organization field in   and    status, and Users who are allowed to view AP documents. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled.

Default:  This feature toggle should be set to  off  for all existing and new customers, by default. Feature Toggle = Off When a user creates or views an AP document, the system does  not  showcase the Purchasing Organization field in the  line item  and in the  Audit Trail , and does not showcase any associated messages. Feature Toggle = On On the contrary, when a user creates or views an AP document, the system showcases the Purchasing Organization field in the  line item  and allows the user to make changes. The system also showcases any associated error messages above the line item section. The system reflects changes done to it in the  Audit Trail . 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes – both documents in process and historically processed documents. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date # Question Recommendation Response Remarks Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 How should we handle documents created between RC-2023-11 and RC-2024-1? The Purchasing Organization will be null if the feature toggle is off. Since the user is not explicitly setting it, it doesn’t make sense for the system to set it behind the scenes. None. 2 Identical to the question above, how should we handle the situation when the feature toggle is enabled initially and then disabled at a later point? The latest settings will take effect on documents being processed. This might not apply as the feature toggle will be deprecated when this is rolled out to Production. None.

Scenarios: Purchasing Organization = Hidden All scenarios The system does  not  showcase the Purchasing Organization field in the  General Information tab  within the line item section (as shown in the screenshot). Purchasing Organization = Optional   or   Required When a user accesses an existing document (this also includes non AP users) The system showcases the Purchasing Organization field in the  General Information tab  within the line item section (as shown in the screenshot) with either an empty/blank or a specific value. When a PO and/or invoice is referenced to a memo / When a PO and/or invoice based cXML memo is created from the Hopper The system instantly downloads and populates the Purchasing Organization information on the document from the PO and/or invoice, if it exists; If not, the system populates the user default (defined by the Admin or the user themselves), if it exists. Otherwise it is left blank. Note:  Additionally, the rules described in the General Rules section will come into play. When a non-PO-non-invoice memo is created from the Hopper (No cXML)   or   when a memo is created from the navigation panel If user defaults are defined (by the Admin or the user themselves), then the system populates that value into the Purchasing Organization field; otherwise, it leaves it empty. When a non-PO-non-invoice memo is created (submitted via cXML) from the Hopper If user defaults are defined (by the Admin or the user themselves), then the system populates that value into the Purchasing Organization field; otherwise, it leaves it empty. Note:  Additionally, the rules described in the General Rules section come into play. The system does  not  apply Machine Learning predictions to the Purchasing Organization field. General Rules: Auto Memos: The user will not be able to update the Purchasing Organization as it is a read-only document entirely. 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes. 7.

When a PO is referenced to a document / When a PO based OCR, cXML, or SP invoice is created from the Hopper / When an invoice is referenced to a memo: The system instantly downloads and populates the Purchasing Organization information on the document from the PO, if it exists; If not, the system populates the user default (defined by the Admin or the user themselves), if it exists. Otherwise it is left blank. Note:  Additionally, the rules described in the General Rules section will come into play. When a non PO invoice (and non-PO-non-invoice memo) is created from the Hopper (No OCR)  or  when an invoice is created from the navigation panel If user defaults are defined (by the Admin or the user themselves), then the system populates that value into the Purchasing Organization field; otherwise, it leaves it empty. When a non PO invoice is created (submitted via cXML or that has undergone OCR) from the Hopper If user defaults are defined (by the Admin or the user themselves), then the system populates that value into the Purchasing Organization field; otherwise, it leaves it empty. Note:  Additionally, the rules described in the General Rules section come into play. The system does  not  apply Machine Learning predictions to the Purchasing Organization field. When a user or system adds a line item: If user defaults are defined (by the Admin or the user themselves), then the system populates that value into the Purchasing Organization field; otherwise, it leaves it empty. They are able to successfully add a line item without populating the Purchasing Organization. Note:  Additionally, the rules described in the General Rules section will come into play. When no Company Code is selected → user navigates to Purchasing Organization in the line item edit view:   The user is able to search and select any  active  and  undeleted  Purchasing Organization from the drop down. When Company Code is selected by a user while editing a line item  or  while updating the Company Code in the header:   If no Purchasing Organizations are associated to the selected/new Company Code: The system leaves the Purchasing Organization field empty. When the user attempts to fill one manually, they are able to search and select Purchasing Organizations that are  not  associated with any (active and undeleted) Company Code in the system, from the drop down.  If Purchasing Organizations are associated to the selected/new Company Code: Single Value: The system instantly auto-populates the Purchasing Organization associated to that Company Code. Multiple Values: The system leaves the Purchasing Organization empty. When the user attempts to fill one manually, they are able to search and select Purchasing Organizations that are directly associated to the Company Code, from the drop down. General Rules: Custom Labels: If defined, the system showcases the Custom Label defined by the Admin for Purchasing Organization in Documents → Custom Labels; if not, the system showcases the default “Purchasing Organization“ label. Purchasing Organization = Hidden   (Current State) Errors:   The system does  not  display any errors related to Purchasing Organization. Transitions: There is impact to the transitions displayed as the Purchasing Organization is hidden from the user. Purchasing Organization = Required Errors:   If Purchasing Organization = blank/null, the system displays an error that the Purchasing Organization is missing, similar to the Plant missing error message. Transitions: The system displays the following transitions as a result of the Purchasing Organization being blank/null:  (Same behavior if Plant was missing) Park Assign Coding Question:  Does the system also show Exception Handling transition in this scenario? Purchasing Organization = Optional Errors: If Purchasing Organization = blank/null, the system does  not  display an error that the Purchasing Organization is missing. Transitions: There is no change in terms of the transitions that the system displays as a result of the Purchasing Organization being blank/null. Apply All: Important Note:  The system exactly mimics the behavior of the Apply All modal of PRs. Purchasing Organization = Hidden The system does  not  showcase the Purchasing Organization field in the Apply All modal. Purchasing Organization = Required The system showcases the Purchasing Organization field in the Apply All modal with a  Required  label. The user is  not  able to update other fields in the Apply All modal without updating the Purchasing Organization. Purchasing Organization = Optional The system showcases the Purchasing Organization field in the Apply All modal with no label. The user is able to update other fields in the Apply All modal without updating the Purchasing Organization. Audit Trail: Purchasing Organization = Required  or  Optional only The system showcases the updates to the Purchasing Organization as the user makes changes to it, after the initial transition. Note:  The implementation should mimic that of Company Code/Plant.  6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes – both documents in process and historically processed documents. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 Can we turn off Purchasing Organization from anywhere in the UI or back-end? No. Just the one in the Documents → Settings → All Documents. 2 Would this have any impact on Accounting Validation feature we built? Probably not. 3 How would adding the Purchasing Organization impact the Apply All modal? Should not have any unforeseen impact. 4 Where is the Purchasing Organization in the Purchasing Parties populated from? Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Do we need a add a feature toggle for this change? No, this can be released to all customers at the same time. 2 Should Purchasing Organization be added to the SP? No. This is not relevant for SP users. 3 How should we handle existing documents (documents in process + processed documents) when the change is released in Production? In   and   status, existing documents will reflect the latest configuration. 4 How should we handle documents in process when Purchasing Organization is enabled-disabled, after being enabled initially? In   and   status, existing documents will reflect the latest configuration. 5 How to handle the scenarios when Purchasing Organization = Hidden, that is, should Purchasing Organization = null in the database? Let it remain as-is. Unclear on what the customer expectations are in various scenarios. Understand customer expectations pre-release. 6 Do we need to consider the Accounting filtering feature toggle for the implementation? How does Plant filtering work? No. 7 Where should the Purchasing Organization error message be placed? Along with the Plant error message.

(refer to  ) The admin should be able to overwrite the automatically generated string name. The admin should be able to provide a unique string name. There should be a help text icon next to string name field. Hovering on should display a tooltip. The tooltip should say “The user can provide the string name optionally. The system will create an auto-generated string name if the user opts not to provide a string name.“ Description (Optional) (Free Text Field)( Do we need this? question for Product. ) Valid From (Optional) (Date picker) The admin should be able to pick a: Past Date Current Date Future Date The admin should be able to leave the field empty. In this case, the system will consider the accounting string valid from its creation. The accounting string will be  Active  by default. Valid To (Optional) (Date picker) The admin should be able to pick a date that can not be older than the date selected for the  Valid From . The admin should be able to leave the field empty. In this case, the system will consider the accounting string valid for an indefinite period of time. The accounting string will remain Active until the admin deactivates it from UI/Bulk Upload or API. The system should mark the newly created accounting string  Active  If the current date lies in the Accounting String duration( the period between  Valid From  and  Valid To ). The system should mark the newly created accounting string  Inactive  If the current date doesn’t lie in the Accounting String duration( the period between  Valid From  and  Valid To ). Under the above fields, there should be a line separator. Under the Line Separator, There should be a subheading for the section. The subheading should be  Company Information. The company objects field should be visible in the  Company Information  based on the following criteria: Company Object should be turned on for the Unit ID Company Object should be configured in the Accounting String Configuration Service. The system should check the Accounting String Configuration Service to determine which the  Company Info  fields are required.  There should be the following fields in the  Company Information  section based on the above-mentioned criteria: The Company Object fields should be a type ahead. The system should fetch only non-deleted active company codes that match the entered phrase in the field. The admin should be able to select one of the available company objects in the type ahead. Under the above Company Information fields, there should be a line separator. Under the Line Separator, There should be a subheading for the section. The subheading should be  Accounting Information. The accounting objects field should be visible in the  Accounting Information  based on the following criteria: Company Object should be turned on for the Unit ID Company Object should be configured in the Accounting String Configuration Service. The system should check the Accounting String Configuration Service to determine which  Accounting Info  fields are required.  If there is any Cost Object defined in the Accounting String Configuration Service, the system should show the  Account Category  dropdown in the  Company Information  section. Suppose only one cost object is defined in the Accounting String Configuration Service. In that case, that object should be auto-selected in the  Account Category  dropdown, and its type ahead field should automatically be visible beneath the  Account Category  dropdown. If there is more than one cost object defined in the Accounting String Configuration Service, the user must select the cost object type from the  Account Category  dropdown. Based on the Cost Object selection in the  Account Category  dropdown, the system should start displaying the selected cost object field beneath the  Account Category  dropdown. All of the  Accounting Information  fields should be a Type Ahead. The system should fetch only non-deleted active accounting objects that match the entered phrase in the field. The admin should be able to select one of the available options in the type ahead. The system should show their custom labels in the  Accounting Strings  table if the custom label is defined for any company and, or accounting objects.  The admin should be able to close the  Accounting String  modal by clicking: ESC button on the keyboard. X icon on the top right corner of the modal. Cancel  button Closing the  Accounting String  modal from any of the avenues mentioned above should not save the accounting string in the DB. The admin should be able to save the  Accounting String  by clicking the  Save  button. The  Accounting String  should be saved in the DB. The admin should be able to see that  Accounting String  on the  Accounting String   Listing  screen. The system should show a green noty message upon accounting string creation. The message should say “New Accounting String “strinName“ created successfully.“ The noty message should be a slider. ( standard existing implementation ) Not Required in this Ticket: All these fields on the Accounting String modal should be filled in with the values for each string that come from API (The Integration team will work on this).

This can be achieved through the following ways: Acceptance Criteria: Reopen For Invoicing Field Support : The  reInvoicingOption  field should be exposed in the public API to manage the behavior of purchase orders when creating a memo. Allowed Values : The  reInvoicingOption  field should accept the following three values: REOPEN_PO (internal enum value: REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : This option allows the items in the memo to be available for invoicing, and the purchase order status will be changed to the previous status before it was invoiced. DONOT_REOPEN_PO (Internal enum value: DO_NOT_REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : This option ensures that the items won't be available for invoicing, and the purchase order status will remain unchanged. KEEP_AS_IS (internal enum value: ALLOW_REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : When this option is selected, the purchase order status will be kept as is, but the items will be made available for invoicing. Default Behavior : The value represents user selection for one of the options available for the re invoicing. If the user does not provide any value for this field, it should be null and not set.  The API should accept one of the supported values ( REOPEN_PO, DONOT_REOPEN_PO, KEEP_AS_IS ) in this field as the user selected value. If user does not provide any value in this field, it should not be set and user should be able to update this in the memo update scenario Accounts Payable Workflow (AP Workflow) :? Is this valid use case where the AP workflow is ON and we are creating the Memo from the API, since this will not trigger the AP workflow and Memo will be directly create in POSTED status from API. Do we need to add any validation in case of AP workflow ON, since we could add validation for supported values based on the AP settings If the AP settings support either PO reopen for invoicing or undetermined or both than the Memo creation is not possible without a user selection (purchaseOrderReInvoicingType will be mandatory in this case.) The public API documentation should be updated and following details should be provided into the  documentation. Development Tasks: Expose the  reInvoicingOption  field in the public API. Implement validation to ensure the field accepts the specified values. Implement default behavior based on AP workflow and CompanySettings. Update the documentation, and also update the minor version in the API documentation and add the change to release notes. Testing Tasks: Verify that the  reInvoicingOption  field is exposed in the API. Test that the field accepts the specified values ( REOPEN_PO, DONOT_REOPEN_PO, KEEP_AS_IS ). Validate that the default behavior is correctly determined based on the AP workflow and CompanySettings. Conduct thorough testing to ensure the feature works as expected. QA Testing Criteria: Verify that the API endpoints for creating memos have been updated to include the  reInvoicingOption  field. Confirm that the specified values are accepted and result in the expected behaviours. Validate that default behavior is correctly determined based on the AP workflow and CompanySettings. Perform end-to-end testing to ensure that creating a memo correctly impacts the purchase order re-invoicing.

Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  Anybody who can view audit logs should be able to see this banner on the document and they should be navigated to the audit logs after clicking on this banner. Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true. What pages should this change impact?  The invoice page. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to handle exceptions and view audit logs. How should this change work? If the  Exception Handler  resolves the Accounting string errors by changing the accounting elements, and  submits  the invoice, then the system should showcase a new  Banner  indicating  Accounting Information Changes , which when clicked on, will open the  Audit trail  and highlight the line item Change Summary where the changes were made. If the  AP Coder  makes changes to the accounting elements in an Invoice, when it is in  Coding  or  Exception  status, then the same thing should happen as mentioned above. When should the Banner  show up ? After the  Exception Handler  or  AP Coder  has  submitted  the Accounting changes, when the Invoice was in  Exception  or  Coding  status. If there is an Audit Trail generated for the Accounting changes in the Change Summary section. Then ideally the Banner would show up in  Draft ,  Parked ,  Pending ,  Exception  (if all exceptions have not been cleared), and  Coding  status. When should the Banner  go away ? Once the Invoice is in  Approved,   Posted ,  Partially Paid  or  Paid  status. If there are  multiple  line items with Accounting changes then how should the Banner behave ? Show  all  line items with accounting changes separately in the Banner. Clicking each one of them takes the user to their appropriate audit trail Summary changes. ( Open to other suggestions if above solutions would hamper the performance. ) If the Invoice went through  multiple iterations  of Accounting Changes during Exception or Coding status, then how should the Banner behave? Show only the  last  update done for all line items with the accounting changes separately in the Banner. Clicking each one of them takes to their last updated audit trail Summary changes. ( Open to other suggestions if above solutions would hamper the performance. ) How should the Banner  look  like ? Banner Description  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions )- \" Accounting Changes Detected! Click here to Review Audit Logs \" \"Accounting Update: See Audit Logs\" \"Accounting Data Revised – Click here to Review\" \"New Accounting Data - Click here for Details\" \"Explore Accounting Changes in Audit Logs\" \"Review Audit Logs for Accounting changes\" Banner Color  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions ) - A suitable option could be  Purple  or a shade of  Magenta , as it\\'s distinct from the existing colors and often signifies changes or notifications. Teal  is distinct from the existing colors and is often associated with notifications and important updates. It can catch the user\\'s attention without being overly intense. Banner Icon Design  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions ) - A small  yellow triangle icon with an exclamation mark  inside the banner. This icon indicates that there\\'s an important change or action required. A small  bell icon  or a  speech bubble icon  inside the banner. These icons are commonly used to signify notifications and changes. A small  clock icon  similar to the Audit logs icon. This icon indicates that there are important changes in the Audit logs.

This should subsequently delete the corresponding user records created in any of the linked child unitIDs that the affected user may have had access to. The user deletion option should not permanently remove the user records from the database layer, as doing so will have negative repercussions throughout the system. instead, these records should be flagged, so they longer show up in an interactive manner, within the applciation. Acceptance Criteira: Prerequisites: The user carrying out these operations should be logged into the Parent unitID The user carrying out these operations should have the Master Admin role assigned to them within the context of the Parent unitID The user being affected by these operations should have been created in the Parent unitID, with a non-Admin role Deleting a user record in the Parent unitID: The Master should be able to click on the “delete” icon for an individual user record, in the user management table.  Clicking on this icon should display a secondary pop-up message for the Master Admin, as king them to confirm that they want to proceed with the intended action.  The modal should have the title “ Are you sure? “ The modal should display the message “ Deleting a user will remove their ability to access any of the business units they may have had access to. This is a non-reversible action. Are you sure you want to proceed with this? “ The modal should present the user with 2 buttons;  Cancel  and  Yes . Clicking on cancel should dismiss the modal, and the system’s state should not change as a result. The affected user’s records will remain as they were.  Clicking on Yes, will proceed with the user record deletion.  Effect of user record deletion on the system’s state: Once a user’s record has been deleted by a Master Admin; via the Parent unitID, the system should …  Mark the affected user’s record as “deleted” in the Parent unitID, so that the user is no longer able to access the Parent unitID. Their user is not visible in the user management table. Nor is their user surfaced as an active, selectable option anywhere in the unitID.  Mark the affected user’s record as “deleted” in all the Child unitIDs that the user had access to, so that the user is no longer able to access those child unitIDs. Their user is not visible in the user management table. Nor is their user surfaced as an active, selectable option anywhere in the unitID. The system should retain all user records at the database layer, so any programmatic / data references to that record remain intact, and none of the system’s functionality breaks as a result of this “deletion”.

       "    'description': 'When a user is reactivated by the Master Admin, ONLY access to the child unitID’s specified in their user record should be reinstated.  What if a child unitID Admin tries to create a user record, for a user that was already provisioned via the linked Parent unitID? Answer: The system should show an appropriate error message. (This should be handled in a separate ticket, at a later date.) Business Case:   Master Admins need the ability to manage user access efficiently across linked child unitIDs from within the Parent unitID. This includes the capability to revoke a user’s access to a specific child unitID when necessary. Currently, while users can be assigned access to multiple child unitIDs, there is no streamlined process for revoking access at the Parent unitID level. Implementing this feature ensures better control over user permissions, reduces security risks, and aligns with governance policies. Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The user must have been originally provisioned via the Parent unitID. The user performing these actions should be a Master Admin, and present in the Parent unitID. Access Revocation Execution: Master Admins should be able to navigate to the user management screen in the Parent unitID. Master Admins should be able to revoke access to a child unitID, by clicking on the \"x\" within the \"pill\" representing that specific unitID, within the \"<add field label here>\" field. Confirmation Message: When a Master Admin clicks on the \"x\" for a child unitID, a confirmation message should appear. The message should inform the Admin of the consequences of revoking access, including: The user will lose access to the selected child unitID. The action is reversible only from the Parent unitID. The user record in the Parent unitID will retain necessary data for potential reinstatement. Message to be displayed in the confirmation modal:  \\'You are about to revoke this user\\'s access to [Child UnitID]. This action will immediately remove their ability to operate within this account. If needed, access can be restored later. Are you sure you want to proceed?\\' The message should include options to  Confirm  or  Cancel  the action. Effects of Revocation: Once confirmed, the following actions should occur: The user should no longer have access to the revoked child unitID. The child unitID should no longer appear in the user’s record within the Parent unitID as an accessible option. The user’s profile should be removed from the child unitID’s user management list. All permissions and configurations for that child unitID should be archived for potential restoration. The user’s Change history should be updated with the details of this event.  The event should record this change the same way that removing values from other multi-select fields (e.g. the Company Code field in the Access section) works. The main change should be displayed in the audit log as “ The value in <field display name> was modified. “ Underneath this, the system should display exactly what change was made, “ - Removed: Business Unit - <Company Name of the Child unitID that was removed> “ Data Retention for Future Restoration: The system should retain the user’s prior configurations for the revoked child unitID. If access is later reinstated, the system should restore the user’s previous configurations by default, if still valid. If any previous configurations are no longer valid, affected fields should be left empty for manual reassignment. Restoration Process & Configuration Validation: If a Master Admin chooses to restore access to the revoked child unitID: The child unitID should be re-added to the user’s accessible unitIDs list. The system should verify the validity of previously assigned configurations. If any settings are outdated or unavailable …  For single select fields, the system should remove the old value and leave them empty For multi-select fields, the system should highlight the affected “pill” with an orange border, show a “?” icon in the pill, where hovering over it will show a message to the Master Admin letting them know what the problem is.  Error Handling: If access revocation fails due to system issues, an error message should notify the Admin and prompt a retry. The message should read: \\'An error occurred while revoking access to [Child UnitID]. Please try again. If the issue persists, contact support.\\' This message should be clearly displayed and provide guidance on the next steps. Testing Considerations: Verify that only Master Admins can revoke access. Ensure that access revocation immediately removes the user from the child unitID’s user list. Validate that reinstating access restores previous configurations unless outdated. Confirm that actions are logged appropriately for audit purposes.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Business Case:   Master Admins in a Parent unitID have the ability to manage access for other users to child unitIDs linked to the Parent unitID they are currently logged into. However, a Master Admin should only be able to assign access to child unitIDs that they themselves have access to. Additionally, if a user’s record contains child unitIDs that the Master Admin does not have access to, those unitIDs should remain hidden from the Master Admin. This ensures that sensitive access information remains restricted, maintaining the principle of least privilege and preventing unnecessary exposure of data. Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The Master Admin must be logged into the Parent unitID. The user record being accessed should contain child unitIDs that may or may not overlap with the Master Admin’s accessible unitIDs. User Record Access & Visibility Constraints: Master Admins should be able to access another user's record via the user management screen in the Parent unitID. When opening a user’s record, the system should display the child unitIDs that the user currently has access to. The only exception to the above rule is that the system should filter out any child unitIDs that the Master Admin does not have access to. The Master Admin should neither see these restricted child unitIDs as selected, nor as selectable options in the user record. Handling of Hidden Child unitIDs: If a user has access to child unitIDs that the Master Admin does not, the system should present the user record as if the user has no access to those unitIDs. There should be no indication that additional child unitIDs exist outside the Master Admin’s scope. Assignment Restrictions: When modifying a user’s child unitID access, the Master Admin should only be able to assign unitIDs that they themselves have access to. Testing Considerations: Verify that a Master Admin can only see and assign child unitIDs that they have access to. Validate that when a Master Admin opens a user record, restricted child unitIDs remain hidden. Test various permission scenarios, including: A Master Admin with full access to all child unitIDs. A Master Admin with limited access to specific child unitIDs. A Master Admin attempting to modify a user’s access beyond their scope.\",\n",

However, they can only assign, view and configure access for the child unitIDs that they themselves have access to.  Info added based on discussion on 01/16/2025:  This ticket will  NOT  deal with scenarios related to revoking access to a specific child unitID, from the user record in the Parent unitID. Business Case: Master Admins need a way to provision and manage accounts for users that will be granted access to multiple child unitIDs. We need to introduce a user management screen to enable this. We also need to update the user record modal to allow Master Admins to configure an individual user’s settings for each child unitID they will have access to.   Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The currently logged in user must be a Master Admin.  The user should be present in the Parent unitID.  The user must have already opened an existing user record, and the system should have already loaded all child unitID configs for that user record.  What can the Master Admin do on the user modal, when editing the user record? Screen 1 Screen 2 Screen 3 When a Master Admin clicks on the “Create a new user” button, the system should display the standard user creation modal to them.  This modal will be different in the following ways from the standard user creation modal shown in child / standalone unitIDs:  In the “Basic Information“ section of the modal, there should be a new single-select drop-down field.  This field should be titled “Primary user Role“.  This drop-down should list 2 options; “Master Administrator“ & “Non-Administrator“.  This field should be empty by default on the modal.  This field should be a required field.  if the user does not select a value in this field, the field should be highlighted with a red border, and the “Save User” button on the modal should remain disabled.  Under the “Basic Information” section, there should be a new section added to the modal, titled “Business Unit Configuration“.  This new section should have the following controls:  A first multi-select type-ahead field titled “Allow access to these business units“. The user should see options for the child unitIDs connected to the currently logged in Parent unitID. The options list should present these options using their respective Company Name values.  The user should be able to search for an option by it’s name, by typing the search terms into the field.  The user should be able to select more than one of these options.  Any option already selected by the user, should no longer be presented as a selectable option in the list.  The selected values should be displayed in the field, in individual “pills”. With a “x” in each pill, to allow the user to remove/deselect one of these choices.  The second single-select type-ahead field titled “User settings for“, should only become visible once the Master Admin has selected at least 1 option in the 1st field.  This drop-down should only present; as options, the choices that the the Master Admin has already selected in the 1st field.  The options should be presented using the child unitID’s company name value.  The user should ONLY be able to select 1 of the listed options at a time.  There should be an informational message in this section, below the fields mentioned above.  The message should be preceded by a yellow “?” (already used elsewhere in the application)  Under this image, there should be the message “Please allow the user to access one or more business units, in order to configure the user's settings for that account.“ This message should be visible whilst the user hasn’t selected any value in the 1st field.  Once the user select’s a value in the 1st field, but has yet to select one in the 2nd field, this message should be replaced by a new message, stating “Please select a business unit, for which you would like to configure this user's account settings.“ The updated message, as well as the “?” image should disappear once the user select's a value in the 2nd field.  The other standard sections of the user modal should be hidden by default.  These sections should ONLY become visible once the Master Admin selects a value for the 2nd field mentioned above.  Every time the Master Admin changes the selection within the 2nd field, the other sections below the “Business Unit Configuration“ section, should be reloaded to reflect the data/settings for the respective child unitID.  All data / configurations from these sections should ONLY be applicable to the user’s record in the child unitID that is currently selected on the modal.  The “Save User” button should remain disabled, until the Master Admin has filled out all required fields on the modal.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Business Case: Master Admins managing users across multiple child unitIDs need the ability to activate or deactivate user records directly from the Parent unitID. This feature will ensure consistent user access control across the system, reducing manual work and the risk of mismanagement. When a user’s record is activated or deactivated (which can be done from the user management grid, or by dismissing an assigned child unitID from the user modal) in the Parent unitID, the system should propagate the change to the relevant child unitIDs, ensuring appropriate access and configurations are maintained or revoked automatically.

Should the user record in the child unitID be created in active, or inactive state?  We should prevent the Master Admin from assigning access to additional child unitIDs, on an inactive user record. The Master Admin should be asked to first reactivate the user record.            to split the 2nd option in the reactivation flow, into it’s own ticket. A modal dialogue; with the title “ Activate User Record “,  should prompt the Master Admin to choose how to proceed: The modal should display the message “ When activating a user, you can choose one of the following options: “ Option 1: Reactivate the user record and restore access to the same child unitIDs as previously configured. Option 2: Reactivate the user record without restoring access to child unitIDs, requiring manual reassignment and reconfiguration.

It is only meant to deal with the original tickets' requirements for making the cells in the first 2 columns of the table editable. See the section highlighted in  Red .  Business Case: As a standard feature, all users that log into a Parent unitID must be able to access a list of child unitIDs that they can navigate to, in order to conduct business. This should be available to Non-admin users in the Parent unitID by default, and to Admin users as an option (once we introduce the reporting dashboard for them).  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The unitID must be configured to work as a Parent unitID There must be at least 2 Child unitIDs connected to it.  The user logging in has access to child unitIDs and must be a Parent unitID user How should the user be able to get to this list of Child unitIDs? When the user logs into the Parent unitID, this is the screen they should land on.  If the user is on another screen in the Parent unitID, they should be able to navigate to this screen by clicking on the “Business Units” link in the left nav bar.  What should the user see on this screen when they land on it? The user should see a message at the top of the screen.  This message should read “ TBD “. The user should be able to dismiss this message by clicking on a “Close” button in the section containing the message.  However, this message should reappear when the user logs into the application again. While still logged in, if the user dismisses the message, there is no need to display it again, for the duration of that logged in session.  When the user navigatess back to the Parent unitID, from a child unitID, the system can once again display the message, unless the user had previously clocked on the “Don’t show again“ checkbox.  The user should be able to dismiss the message for good, by checking the “Don’t show again“ checkbox next to the “Close” button.  The user should see the page title as “Business Units“ The user should see a table below that, with the following columns:  Business Unit Description Last Accessed on Action The Business Unit column should list all the Child unitIDs linked to the current Parent unitID, that the logged in user has access to. By default, this list should display the values found in these Child unitID’s Company  → Profile → Company Name field.  The Description column should only display a value if the Parent unitID Admin provides a description for this Child unitID. Otherwise, the column can show an “n/a” for rows that do not have a description.  The Last Accessed on column should display the most recent date that the user navigated to that specific child unitID. This value should be updated by the system, every time the user navigates to that specific Child unitID.  The Action column should include icons for the following controls:  Edit The Edit icon should ONLY be available to the user if they have the Parent unitID Admin role assigned.  The Edit icon should be a pencil glyph Clicking on this should make the first 2 cells for that specific row editable. and change the pencil icon to a “save” icon (perhaps a “tick mark”).  The cell in the Business Unit column is mandatory. The user should not be able to save the row without providing some value in this cell. This cell CANNOT use the same value as another Child unitID that’s connected to the current Parent unitID. If the user enters such a value, the system should highlight the text input field with a red border, and display a red “!” icon in the input field; aligned to the right edge of the field. Hovering over this icon should display a tool-tip with the message “TBD“.  The cell in the Description column is optional. The user can save the row without providing a value in this field if they don’t want to.  Navigate to The Navigate to icon should be visible to all users that log into the Parent unitID and have access to that specific Child unitID.  The Navigate to icon should be a square with an arrow pointing up and to the right, out of it.  Clicking on this should navigate the user to that specific child unitID, in the same browser tab.  How many unitIDs will be listed in this table? There is no restriction at the moment, on how many child unitIDs can be linked to a parent unitID, or how many of those a single user can be given access to.  The table should list a maximum of 10 rows, after which it should paginate the data.\",\n",

These users should also be able to navigate back to the Parent unitID, and even jump to another child unitID, from the one they’re already present in. This ticket build upon the following previous JIRAs:         Acceptance Criteria: Prequisites: The user must be logged into the Parent unitID.  The user must have access to Child unitIDs.  How can a user navigate from the Parent unitID, to a child untiID? When the user logs into the Parent unitID, they will be presented with this list of child unitID’s they have access to. (See   for details) This list will be populated based on the data in the user’s record. (See   for details) The user can either click on the child unitID’s name, or the “ → “ icon for that row.  Clicking on either will navigate the user to that specific child unitID, in the same browser window/tab.  How will the user know when they are in a child unitID? When the user is in a child unitID, the application will include a persistent header at the top of the standard Vroozi UI.  This header will include the message “You are currently logged into <Business Unit>“.  Where the value of <Business Unit> will be dynamically determined based on the specific child unitID’s Company Name value.  This header will remain in place as long as the user is present in the child unitID, to ensure that they are always aware of the context in which they are operating.  How will the user navigate back to the Parent unitID? At any point, if the user feels like navigating back to the parent unitID that they originally logged into, they can click the “Go back to <Business Unit>“ button.  The value of <Business Unit> in this case will be determined dynamically based on the company name value of the Parent unitID.  This button will be a persistent presence in the header mentioned above.  When the user clicks on this button, the system will navigate the user to the landing screen of the Parent unitID, in the same browser window/tab.  once they’re back in the parent unitID, the persistent banner; mentioned above, will no longer be visible on the screen.  How can a user navigate to another child unitID, from the one they’re currently logged into? At any point; whilst logged into a child unitID, if the user feels like navigating to a different child unitID, they can do so by using the unitID selection control in the persistent header.  There will be a single-select drop-down field in the header, labeled “Switch Business Unit:“.  This drop-down will present as a list of options, the child unitIDs that the user has access to, based on their user record. (See   for details) This drop-down must display; as the selected option, the child unitID that the user is currently present in.

We need to introduce a user management screen to enable this. We also need to update the user record modal to allow Master Admins to configure an individual user’s settings for each child unitID they will have access to.   Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The currently logged in user must be a Master Admin.  The user should be present in the Parent unitID.  How should the Master Admin access the user management screen? The user should be able to see a navigation option in the left nav bar titled “Users“.  Clicking on this link should navigate the user to the User management screen.  This screen should be similar to the standard Vroozi user management screen in child / standalone unitIDs.  Note: This ticket does not cover the Bulk Upload Functionality for this screen.  The Master Admin should be able to perform all the standard CRUD operations related to user records, from this screen. Including:  User creation User activation / deactivation User deletion How should a Master Admin add a new user record? Screen 1 Screen 2 Screen 3 When a Master Admin clicks on the “Create a new user” button, the system should display the standard user creation modal to them.  This modal will be different in the following ways from the standard user creation modal shown in child / standalone unitIDs:  In the “Basic Information“ section of the modal, there should be a new single-select drop-down field.  This field should be titled “Primary user Role“.  This drop-down should list 2 options; “Master Administrator“ & “Non-Administrator“.  This field should be empty by default on the modal.  This field should be a required field.  if the user does not select a value in this field, the field should be highlighted with a red border, and the “Save User” button on the modal should remain disabled.  Under the “Basic Information” section, there should be a new section added to the modal, titled “Business Unit Configuration“.  This new section should have the following controls:  A first multi-select type-ahead field titled “Allow access to these business units“. The user should see options for the child unitIDs connected to the currently logged in Parent unitID. The options list should present these options using their respective Company Name values.  The user should be able to search for an option by it’s name, by typing the search terms into the field.  The user should be able to select more than one of these options.  Any option already selected by the user, should no longer be presented as a selectable option in the list.  The selected values should be displayed in the field, in individual “pills”. With a “x” in each pill, to allow the user to remove/deselect one of these choices.  The second single-select type-ahead field titled “User settings for“, should only become visible once the Master Admin has selected at least 1 option in the 1st field.  This drop-down should only present; as options, the choices that the the Master Admin has already selected in the 1st field.  The options should be presented using the child unitID’s company name value.  The user should ONLY be able to select 1 of the listed options at a time.  There should be an informational message in this section, below the fields mentioned above.  The message should be preceded by a yellow “?” (already used elsewhere in the application)  Under this image, there should be the message “Please allow the user to access one or more business units, in order to configure the user's settings for that account.“ This message should be visible whilst the user hasn’t selected any value in the 1st field.  Once the user select’s a value in the 1st field, but has yet to select one in the 2nd field, this message should be replaced by a new message, stating “Please select a business unit, for which you would like to configure this user's account settings.“ The updated message, as well as the “?” image should disappear once the user select's a value in the 2nd field.  The other standard sections of the user modal should be hidden by default.  These sections should ONLY become visible once the Master Admin selects a value for the 2nd field mentioned above.  Every time the Master Admin changes the selection within the 2nd field, the other sections below the “Business Unit Configuration“ section, should be reloaded to reflect the data/settings for the respective child unitID.  All data / configurations from these sections should ONLY be applicable to the user’s record in the child unitID that is currently selected on the modal.  The “Save User” button should remain disabled, until the Master Admin has filled out all required fields on the modal.  Should the user history functionality be split out into a separate ticket? Or will that just work out of the box?  Need a new ticket for the user audit trail.  How should the user be informed that their account has been provisioned in the Parent unitID? The user whose account has just been created, should receive the standard account creation confirmation email.  This email should allow them to create a password for the Parent unitID.\",\n",

Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The unitID must be configured to work as a Parent unitID There must be at least 2 Child unitIDs connected to it.  The user logging in has access to child unitIDs and must be a Parent unitID user How should the user be able to get to this list of Child unitIDs? When the user logs into the Parent unitID, this is the screen they should land on.  If the user is on another screen in the Parent unitID, they should be able to navigate to this screen by clicking on the “Business Units” link in the left nav bar.  What should the user see on this screen when they land on it? The user should see a message at the top of the screen.  This message should read “ TBD “. The user should be able to dismiss this message by clicking on a “Close” button in the section containing the message.  However, this message should reappear when the user logs into the application again.

When the user navigatess back to the Parent unitID, from a child unitID, the system can once again display the message, unless the user had previously clocked on the “Don’t show again“ checkbox.  The user should be able to dismiss the message for good, by checking the “Don’t show again“ checkbox next to the “Close” button.  The user should see the page title as “Business Units“ The user should see a table below that, with the following columns:  Business Unit Description Last Accessed on Action The Business Unit column should list all the Child unitIDs linked to the current Parent unitID, that the logged in user has access to. By default, this list should display the values found in these Child unitID’s Company  → Profile → Company Name field.  The Description column should only display a value if the Parent unitID Admin provides a description for this Child unitID. Otherwise, the column can show an “n/a” for rows that do not have a description.  The Last Accessed on column should display the most recent date that the user navigated to that specific child unitID. This value should be updated by the system, every time the user navigates to that specific Child unitID.  The Action column should include icons for the following controls:  Edit The Edit icon should ONLY be available to the user if they have the Parent unitID Admin role assigned.  The Edit icon should be a pencil glyph Clicking on this should make the first 2 cells for that specific row editable. and change the pencil icon to a “save” icon (perhaps a “tick mark”).  The cell in the Business Unit column is mandatory. The user should not be able to save the row without providing some value in this cell. This cell CANNOT use the same value as another Child unitID that’s connected to the current Parent unitID. If the user enters such a value, the system should highlight the text input field with a red border, and display a red “!” icon in the input field; aligned to the right edge of the field. Hovering over this icon should display a tool-tip with the message “ TBD “.  The cell in the Description column is optional. The user can save the row without providing a value in this field if they don’t want to.  Navigate to The Navigate to icon should be visible to all users that log into the Parent unitID and have access to that specific Child unitID.  The Navigate to icon should be a square with an arrow pointing up and to the right, out of it.  Clicking on this should navigate the user to that specific child unitID, in the same browser tab.

Alternatively, if the user logging into the system is identified as NOT belonging to a parent unitID, they should be directed to the single child unitID that they belong to, as usual.  Why do this? Why don’t we just log the parent unitID’s user directly into the parent unitID, like we do for child unitID users? The reason we are adding this logic to the authentication process is because, in the future, we will want to allow Admins in the parent unitID to selectively “upgrade” a child unitID’s user to a parent unitID user. Whereby, when that upgraded user logs into Vroozi in the future, we will want to route them to the parent unitID, instead of the child unitID their user account was originally created in.  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The feature flag added in    should be enabled for this parent unitID.  There should be at least 1 child unitID linked to this parent unitID.  One or more users should exist in this parent unitID and be active.  One or more users should exist in the linked child unitID(s) and be active.  There should be a way to identify users with access to a parent unitID. This identifier could, in the futre, be used for reporting as well.  When the user enters their username/passwrod combination on the Vroozi login screen, and submits it to the BE service for processing, the system should fetch the user’s record from the DB based on the provided credentials.  From this user record, the system needs to determine if this user has access to the parent unitID, or to a child unitID. If the system determines that the user belongs to a parent unitID, then the user should be routed to the relevant parent unitID.  If the system determines that the user does not belong to a parent unitID, then the user should be routed to the appropriate child unitID that they belong to.   to create a separate ticket for this requirement below:   A user CANNOT exist in multiple child unitIDs without also belonging to a parent unitID.',\n",

Supplier Portal > Invoices page Which users should be impacted by the change? SP User. How should this feature work? Invoice Action Options: For any invoice in \"Disputed\" status, the SP user should see two distinct action options when clicking the 3 dots against the invoice: View Invoice. Edit Invoice. View Invoice Action: Clicking on  \"View Invoice\"  opens the invoice in a  non-editable  (read-only) view. The user sees the standard set of invoice options:  Void, Amend, and Reject . Edit Invoice Action: Clicking on  \"Edit Invoice\"  moves the invoice directly into an  \"Amend\"  state. Invoice immediately becomes editable, allowing modifications. All standard editing functionalities applicable to invoices in the \"Amend\" state are available to the user. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  Maybe. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams.

Improved Multi-Selection Display: Modify the way multiple dispute reasons are displayed in the  Reason(s)  field. Instead of truncating selections (which currently limits visibility to 1 or 2 reasons), display multiple reasons in a  stacked format (one below the other)  similar to how the  Company Code Restrictions  field is displayed in the system today.
