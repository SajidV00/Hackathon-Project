It appears that the  /purchase-orders/submit  endpoint is not storing the external ID when posting the Purchase Order information with the external ID instead it is trying to create a new Purchase Order.

Which customers should this change impact? Customers who have  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW  = true, and  Dispute Invoice via Supplier Portal  toggle = ON. What pages should this change impact? Supplier Portal > Invoices page Which users should be impacted by the change? SP User. How should this feature work? The  Invoices page  in the Supplier Portal should display invoices with the following statuses: Disputed Voided The  Status Filter  on the Invoices page should include the following options: Disputed Voided All other existing invoice statuses When a Supplier Portal user selects  Disputed  from the Status Filter, only invoices marked as  Disputed  should be displayed. When a Supplier Portal user selects  Voided  from the Status Filter, only invoices marked as  Voided  should be displayed.

This ensures that I am not exposed to incomplete or non-functional features and reduces potential confusion or frustration. Acceptance Criteria : Initial State (Feature Hidden): Users should not see any Invoice Dispute Process-related UI elements or functionalities. Feature Toggle Implementation: Introduce a temporary feature toggle (e.g.,  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW__INVOICE_DISPUTE ) to control the visibility of the Invoice Dispute Process features. When the toggle is  off , the Invoice Dispute Process features remain hidden. When the toggle is  on , all developed Invoice Dispute Process features become visible and usable by all users. Toggle Removal Post-Completion: Once the Invoice Dispute Process feature is completely developed for Supplier Portal clients, remove the temporary feature toggle and ensure the feature is permanently visible to the users. Testing & Verification: Verify that toggling the switch on/off reliably hides and shows the Invoice Dispute Process features.

( Future - not part of this ticket, but for reference ) If the invoice can only be disputed via email, it should be pre-selected and cannot be changed by the AP user. Recipient : For Supplier Portal (SP) Invoices: If an SP invoice is disputed, the dispute is assigned to the SP user who created and sent the invoice, as long as they are still active. Example :   Adam creates SP Invoice 90000056789. If disputed, the dispute goes to Adam if he's still active. If the original SP user is inactive, the AP user can select another SP user from a list of all SP users linked to the supplier. (   to check what the current system behavior is on who can see the invoice and accordingly decide Administrator or Order Processor should be allowed to take the action. ) Example :   If Adam is inactive, the AP user can assign the dispute to another SP user, like Ryan. If no SP users are active for the supplier, the invoice cannot be disputed via the Supplier Portal. For Non-SP Invoices (Email, OCR, cXML, API) and Manually Created Invoices  (Will confirm with internal stakeholders regarding disputes for manual invoices) : If disputed, the AP user can assign the dispute to an SP user from a list of SP users linked to the supplier. Example :   Matthew sends Invoice 90000056452 via email. If disputed, the AP user can assign it to Adam, Matthew, or Ryan. If no SP users are active for the supplier, the invoice cannot be disputed. Future Consideration: Support for notifying multiple or all SP users linked to the supplier for disputes may be added later.

This causes confusion, as the displayed role does not accurately reflect the user\u2019s group-based designation. To enhance clarity, the system should update the  Role  column in the  Users Grid  to reflect the  correct role label  based on the  user's assigned user group  instead of the default group setting. Note :    We had briefly discussed this back during the Phase 2 implementation. I believe this can be done more efficiently with fewer API calls, but we didn\u2019t pursue it at the time due to the tight deadline for completing the MVP project. Here is comment for reference -   and     Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? As a  PMAN Admin , I want to see the  correct role labels  in the  User Grid  of  SDM > Master Data > Users  and  PMAN > Master Data > Users , So that I can accurately identify users based on their  actual assigned user group  rather than a default setting. Which customers should this change impact?  Customers using the SDM module (ex: NBCU). What pages should this change impact? PMAN > Master Data > Users. SDM > Master Data > Users. Which users should be impacted by the change? PMAN Admin. How should this feature work? Role Label Updates Based on User Group: The  Role  column in the  Users Grid  should reflect the  correct user group label  configured for each user, rather than using the  Default User Group  setting. Example -  If a user belongs to the  Redbook  user group, their role should be displayed as: Redbook Admin Redbook Power User Redbook Basic User Example - If a user belongs to the  Directory  user group, their role should be displayed as: Directory Admin Directory Power User Directory Basic User This applies to  both  the  SDM  and  PMAN User Grid  views. PMAN Admins See the Correct Labels for Users from Different User Groups: Instead of seeing all users under a  single default group label  (e.g., \"Discovery Power User\" for all users), PMAN Admins should see: John as a Redbook Power User Matt as a Directory Power User Other users based on their user group labels Retain Existing Labeling for Redbook and Directory Admins: Redbook Admins should continue to see only Redbook users with the appropriate  Redbook  role labels. Directory Admins should continue to see only Directory users with the appropriate  Directory  role labels. No change in behavior for these user groups.

No, we do not need to connect to the service at the time of configuration, we need to store this information properly. 3 Need to have the gateway or connector API as well No, we do not need a way to communicate to external system during configuration, this is already done during the actual invocation of the service. 4 IF there is no endpoint from the external system to validate credentials without the actual payload. 5 Do we need to add the type of the service as well? Yes, I think it should be to make this configuration generic. 6 Can you please confirm the expected behavior for the  url  field? Should the system allow storing plain text if no valid URL is provided, or should it strictly enforce a proper URL format?     It should be URL only field.",

With client interest growing, we need to ensure our integration meets Avalara\u2019s latest connection guidelines and security requirements. So, the objective of this R&D initiative is to: Assess the current integration to determine its compatibility with Avalara\u2019s latest API and security standards. Identify required upgrades to meet the new connection guidelines and ensure a stable, production-ready integration. Document findings and provide recommendations for implementation. Scope Review the existing Avalara integration. Compare against Avalara\u2019s latest API and integration guidelines. Identify deprecated endpoints, authentication changes, and compliance needs. Test the existing integration using sandbox/production credentials and validate actual features. Document findings and provide recommendations for upgrades. Research & Approach Review Avalara\u2019s latest API documentation to check for changes, deprecations, and security updates. Assess authentication and security to ensure compliance with Avalara\u2019s policies. Test the existing sandbox integration to identify failures, performance issues, and API updates required. Compare sandbox vs. production requirements to ensure a seamless upgrade. Document findings and risks, including code changes, potential challenges, and mitigation strategies. Acceptance Criteria Technical Assessment Report:  Current state analysis, compatibility gaps, and required updates. Upgrade Roadmap:  Action plan with development and testing estimates. Test Plan:  Steps for validating the upgraded integration.",

The system should throw the validation error if the specified budget is not in the list of budgets fetched based on the update logic mentioned above. Please note that we will update the budget query soon as it is intricate and very cumbersome to understand. \u00a0 Technical Details:    Q&A:  Integration Team  (                           ) Question Response Action Status Where is the budget query in PO?",
