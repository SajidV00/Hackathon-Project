        "description": "Business Case : As an  Admin , I want the system to determine approval rules based on the accounting combination with the  highest total amount  across  all line items , rather than solely relying on the first line item's accounting combination. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  Modify the Approval Matching Technique to consider the accounting combination with the  highest total amount  across  all line items , rather than the current implementation where approval rule selection is based solely on the first line item's accounting combination. Which Customer should this change impact?  Customers using the new  Dynamic Approval Workflow  feature toggle and  new BE setting  /  Option (b)  from this ticket -  . Important Notes: The new workflow enhancements will only be enabled for Maersk and Forest Lawn initially. This solution was specifically designed to handle Maersk\u2019s 1st line item matching concerns. For all other customers for whom this will be turned off, the existing functionality will prevail (for both Vroozi Invoice and Purchase). What pages should this change impact?  PR, CR, Invoice, Memo, PRQ. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins, Approvers, AP Approvers. How should this change work? Pre-Requisites: Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. Overview : The change involves enhancing the Approval Matching Technique to consider the accounting combination with the highest total amount across all line items when determining the appropriate approval rule for a document. Functionality : When a document is submitted for approval, the system should analyze  all line items  to identify unique accounting combinations. For each unique accounting combination, the system should  add up  and calculate the  total amount  associated with all line items containing that combination. The system should take  Split accounting  into consideration as well. The system should then identify the accounting combination with the  highest  total amount. Based on the accounting combination with the highest total amount, the system should select the corresponding approval rule for the document. The Approval Rule matching should be selected based on our current implementation done in this ticket -    Total Amount  =  Calculated Total  ( that takes Unit Price, Quantity, Tax, Shipping and discount into consideration ) Certain Use Cases : If there is  only 1   accounting combination  with the  highest total  amount, then use this accounting combination to determine the closest Approval Rule match. If there are  2 or more  different  accounting combination  with the  same  highest total  amount, then Select the 1st accounting combination in the line item order. Check whether this line item has an Approval rule matching with it or not. If no matching rule found for the 1st accounting combination then select the next accounting combination and check the Approval matching rule against it. Example : Invoice has 5 line items. Line #2 has Split accounting. Each Accounting combination has a total amount related to its respective line item. Line Number Split Accounting Accounting Combination Total amount #1 No CC1 + Cost1 + GL1 $50 #2.1 Yes CC1 + Cost1 + GL2 $25 #2.2 Yes CC1 + Cost2 + GL2 $150 #3 No CC1 + Cost2 + GL2 $65 #4 No CC1 + Cost3 + GL1 + Customer1 $100 #5 No CC1 + Cost1 + GL1 $75 Total amount for each accounting combination added up to - CC1 + Cost1 + GL1 = $50 + $75 = $125 (Line #1 + Line #5) CC1 + Cost1 + GL2 = $25 (Line #2.1) CC1 + Cost2 + GL2  = $150 + $65 =  $215  (Selected) (Line #2.2 + Line #3) CC1 + Cost3 + GL1 + Customer1 = $100 (Line #4) Accounting Combination  CC1 + Cost2 + GL2  should be selected based on the Total amount of  $215 , that is highest amongst other accounting combinations. The system will now try to find the closest Approval rule match against this  Selected  accounting Combination. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All. Questions : Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date",

The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. UI Design for Approval Matching Technique Settings Add a new section with  title  called as - \u201c Approval Matching Technique \u201d. Add a  short description  below the title - \u201cThis setting determines the method by which approval rules are applied to documents.\u201d Add a  sub-title  below this description - \u201c Choose how would you like to match approvals: \u201d Add  2 options  below the sub-title - \u201cApprove based on the first line item's accounting combination.\u201d Add  tooltip  besides Option  (a)  - \u201c The system assigns approval rules based on the accounting combination found in the first line item of the document, without considering other line items. \u201d \u201cApprove based on the accounting combination with the highest total amount across all line items.\u201d Add  tooltip  besides Option  (b)  - \u201c The system evaluates all unique accounting combinations across all line items, including individual split accounting combinations. It selects the accounting combination with the highest total amount and assigns the corresponding approval rule. \u201d Template : You can design something like this. It doesn\u2019t have to be exactly this way. Please ensure that this section blends seamlessly into the Workflow page. If you have a better way of displaying the above settings, please feel free to share your suggestions. UI Implementation of Approval Matching Technique Settings Approval Matching Technique  settings should  only  be visible when the client is using the new Dynamic Approval Workflow. The system should  only  allow the Admin to select  one  option at a time. When the new Dynamic Approval Workflow is turned  ON  for the  first time  for a client, the system should select  Option (a)  by default. BE Implementation of Approval Matching Technique Settings Option (a)  - \u201c Approve based on the first line item's accounting combination. \u201d Utilize the original implementation that was developed according to the Original MVP ticket -    Option (b)  - \u201c Approve based on the accounting combination with the highest total amount across all line items. \u201d Implement the new Approval rule matching logic introduced in this ticket -    Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All.

      "description": "Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( \u2014 ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline. Success Criteria: Effective implementation of T&Cs management and assignment system enhancements. Improved flexibility and control for Admins and Buyers in handling T&Cs. Seamless integration with existing systems and processes. Positive feedback from primary stakeholders, Yukon and Maersk. Milestones: MVP - Minimum Viable Product: Product manager to validate assumptions and solution design with stakeholders. Engineering to complete    MUP - Minimum Useable Product:                                     Purchase Order: Allow Buyers to create and associate Ad-hoc T&Cs to a specific PO Purchase Order: Print the correct T&Cs on the PO PDF Vroozi Admin: Allow Admins to specify whether PO T&Cs can be updated via the POCR function POCR: Allow only the \u201cPO Owner\u201d to update T&Cs via POCR POCR: Record and display T&Cs changes done on a PO, in the PO Document Change History Integration team  \u2192 SPIKE: Integration team needs to investigate impact on NBCU, if T&Cs can be updated vai POCR Payables team  \u2192 Supplier Portal: Display PO T&Cs in the Vroozi Supplier Portal Payables team  \u2192 Supplier Portal: Ensure SP users are able to Confirm / Dispute T&Cs changes on a PO updated via POCR MLP - Minimum Lovable Product: Vroozi Admin: Figure out how to introduce an \u201cApply to All\u201d option for associations SPIKE: Investigate how we can compute, store and display a fine grained \u201cDiff\u201d for the T&Cs content, when updated by an Admin         Integration team  \u2192     POCR: Allow Admins to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Allow Central Reciever to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Ensure that T&Cs updates on POs; done via POCR, are reviewed and approved by the \u201cPO Owner\u201d Vroozi PMAN: Allow Buyers, Admins, Central Receivers to create custom T&Cs and save them in their user profile for reuse at a later date Vroozi PMAN: Allow users to view and manage their custom T&Cs from their \u201cMy Data\u201d screen \u00a0 The wireframes for this project can also be found here:",

The reason being, that in this case, we DO NOT want the user to unset these T&Cs as the unitID default. Case #2: If there are more than 1 sets of custom T&Cs in the unitID, then if the user opens up the editing modal for one that has already been set as the unitID default. Then the toggle should be in the \u201c On \u201d state, and it SHOULD be in read-only mode.

The implementation of a background service designed to capture and log every modification to the custom T&Cs within a unitID addresses several critical needs within the organization: By systematically recording who made changes, when these changes were made, the method used for the changes (API, bulk upload, UI), and the specific nature of the changes, the organization can ensure a higher level of compliance with internal policies and external regulatory requirements. This comprehensive change log will serve as an essential tool for audits, offering a clear trail of modifications for accountability and verification purposes. Additionally, in instances of errors or disputes regarding the custom T&Cs, having a detailed history of changes can expedite resolution. By identifying when a change was made and by whom, it is easier to trace back through the decision-making process, understand the context of the modifications, and, if necessary, correct errors or address disputes more efficiently. Finally, in the future, by analyzing the change logs, the organization can identify patterns or trends in the modifications of the T&Cs, which can inform future improvements to the contract management processes, training needs for users, or enhancements to the T&Cs themselves.

If the user tries to save a set of custom T&Cs that has the same name as an existing set, then the system should not allow the user to save that set when the \u201c Save \u201d button is clicked. Instead, the user should be shown an error message under/above the \u201c Save \u201d button. This message should read \u201c Oops!

The first field should be a single select type ahead, and the user should only have 2 options in it;  Company Codes  and  Suppliers . If the user selects the  Company Codes  option, the 2nd field should be a multi-select type ahead. This field should show all the active company codes in the unitID. Any company codes that have already been selected in this field, should not be part of the list of options presented to the user. Each selected option should be listed in the field as a \u201c pill \u201d with a \u201c x \u201d in order to remove it as a selection. If the source data for one of these selections is deactivated, or deleted from the unitID, the next time the Admin is looking at this field, that particular selection should be highlighted orange, with a \u201c?\u201d in the pill. Hovering over the \u201c?\u201d should let the user know that this value is no longer available in the unitID. If the user selects the  Supplier  option, the 2nd field should be a multi-select type ahead. This field should show all the active suppliers in the unitID. Any suppliers that have already been selected in this field, should not be part of the list of options presented to the user.

        "summary": "Vroozi Admin : Allow Admin to create new custom T&Cs",
        "description": "Business Case: The current system limitation only allows for the management of a single, predefined set of Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) for each unitID, restricting administrative flexibility and responsiveness to changing contractual requirements. This enhancement aims to introduce a feature enabling the creation, management, and assignment of multiple sets of custom T&Cs within each unitID. This functionality is critical for accommodating diverse and evolving contractual obligations specific to different suppliers or scenarios. By allowing for the dynamic creation of custom T&Cs, the system will empower administrators to tailor contractual language to specific needs, improving compliance, and operational efficiency. What\u2019s wrong with the current UI?   The current UI is only meant to handle a single set of custom T&Cs for a unitID. It displays a single rich text editor, which allows the Admins to define the custom T&Cs that the unitID will use. This bakes in the assumption that there will always be just one set of T&Cs that will be used across all POs that the unitID issues to all suppliers.  What value will the updated UI bring? This new UI will be inspired by other master data creation/editing interfaces used in the application. This will enable the creation and editing of an arbitrary number of custom T&Cs that an Admin might want to maintain for the unitID.   Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: If the feature flag added in   has not been removed from the system. Then the unitID MUST have this feature flag enabled.  The data table defined in    must have already been developed, so that any custom T&Cs that are created, can be displayed in it.    Impacted Vroozi Roles Which user roles within the Vroozi Admin system will be affected by this change? PMAN Admin Data-Fix Necessity   Will there be any requirement for data migration or transformation as part of this change? TBD \u2026 If required, please provide details of what the expected effect of this data fix will be:  TBD \u2026 Change this \u2026  To this \u2026                                                                                + Ignore the tab bar from the wireframe diagram for the scope of this ticket. When should the user see the new T&Cs creation modal? Admins must be able to create a new set of custom T&Cs from within the unitID's  Documents \u2192 Settings \u2192 Purchase Orders  screen\u2019s \u201c Terms & Conditions \u201c management section. When the Admin clicks on the \u201c Add T&Cs \u201d button, the system should open up a new modal dialogue.  What should the user see the on the new T&Cs creation modal? This new modal should be titled \u201c Create Custom Terms & Conditions \u201c This modal should include fields called \" Name \" and \" Description \u201d The name field should be limited to < TBD > number of chars The description field should be limited to < TBD > number of chars The system must support rich text editing for the T&Cs content to allow for detailed and formatted contractual language. Under the T&Cs content, this modal should also display controls to associate the T&Cs with specific suppliers or company codes. These controls should have the label \u201c Associate these T&Cs with: \u201c By default, there should  NOT  be any additional attributes associated to the set of custom T&Cs being created. Instead, there should be the placeholder text \u201c These Terms & Conditions are not currently associated to any PO attributes. Please click on the \u201c+\u201c to specify any desired associations. \u201c There should be a clickable \u201c + \u201d button under this placeholder text.  When the user clicks on this button, the placeholder text should be replaced by UI controls to allow the association of these T&Cs with PO attributes.  These controls should be layed out in 2-columns, where the 1st column is titled \u201c Purchase Order Attribute \u201c and the 2nd one is titled \u201c Values \u201c. The 1st column should display a single select drop-down; with the following options for now: Company Codes Supplier When a new row is added, neither of the options mentioned above should be selected by default. The 2nd column should display a multi-select type-ahead field By default, this field should be inactive, until the user makes a selection in the 1st field.  There should be a \u201cx\u201d, or trash can button to the right of the 2nd input control. There should be a \u201c X \u201d  button in the top-right corner of this modal. Clicking this should just close the modal, without modifying the state of the system.  There should be 2 action buttons in the footer of this modal.  The first button should be a \u201c Cancel \u201d button, which should functionally behave in an identical manner to the \u201c X \u201d button at the top of the modal.  The 2nd button should be a \u201c Save \u201d button, which, when clicked will save the user\u2019s provided information, and update the system state accordingly.  What is the minimum/required set of data/information that a user MUST provide, when creating a set of custom T&Cs? At a minimum, the user MUST provide data in the following fields on this modal, in order for the \u201c Save \u201d button to become active and clickable:  A Name for the set of custom T&Cs being created.  Content for the set of custom T&Cs being created.  What additional, optional data can the user provide , when creating a set of custom T&Cs? Optionally, the user can also provide the following information about the set of custom T&Cs being created:  A Description for the set of custom T&Cs being created.  The Suppliers and/or Company Codes that the set of custom T&Cs should be associated with.  Is there any user specified information on a set of custom T&Cs that will be used as a uniqueness constraint in the T&Cs management system? The system should ensure that any set of custom T&Cs that\u2019s being created, should be unique within the unitID.  This uniqueness check should be based on the T&Cs name.  If the user tries to save a set of custom T&Cs that has the same name as an existing set, then the system should not allow the user to save that set when the \u201c Save \u201d button is clicked. Instead, the user should be shown an error message under/above the \u201c Save \u201d button. This message should read \u201c Oops! Another set of custom T&Cs with the same name already exists. \u201c Should the uniqueness check be case sensitive or not?  Follow whatever pattern is the standard across the system.  How should the Company Code and/or Supplier association controls work on this modal? The first field should be a single select type ahead, and the user should only have 2 options in it;  Company Codes  and  Suppliers . If the user selects the  Company Codes  option, the 2nd field should be a multi-select type ahead.  This field should show all the active company codes in the unitID.  The company code\u2019s code + description should be shown here Any company codes that have already been selected in this field, should not be part of the list of options presented to the user.  Each selected option should be listed in the field as a \u201c pill \u201d with a \u201c x \u201d in order to remove it as a selection.  If the source data for one of these selections is deactivated, or deleted from the unitID, the next time the Admin is looking at this field, that particular selection should be highlighted orange, with a \u201c?\u201d in the pill. Hovering over the \u201c?\u201d should let the user know that this value is no longer available in the unitID.  If the user selects the  Supplier  option, the 2nd field should be a multi-select type ahead.  This field should show all the active suppliers in the unitID.  The Display Name from the supplier record should be shown here Any suppliers that have already been selected in this field, should not be part of the list of options presented to the user.  Each selected option should be listed in the field as a \u201c pill \u201d with a \u201c x \u201d in order to remove it as a selection.

Question Answer Q asked by \u2026  Q asked on \u2026 A provided by \u2026 A provided on \u2026 Should the duplicate check logic be case sensitive or not? Use whatever pattern we\u2019re following throughout the rest of the system.           you have mentioned rich text editor for T&Cs text. Do we need to test the entire functionality of the toolbar of rich text editor in the scope of this ticket? No, that shouldn\u2019t be necessary. As long as the FE devs are using the same component as we use today, you guys can just do basic regression testing against that component.    Mar 13, 2024      Is the editing of the newly created T&Cs also comes in the scope of this ticket? No. Editing will be covered in a different ticket.      Mar 13, 2024     Validate and approve the messages added for the following scenarios:  - When a new set of T&Cs is successfully added in the DB: \" New terms and conditions added successfully \" Change the message to \u201c New Terms & Conditions added successfully \u201c.         Provide a message to display on the UI, in case there is a technical error preventing a new set of T&Cs from being created.  Use the message \u201c Oops! Something went wrong.

Admin should be able to download the error report if there are any issues while uploading the Approval Rule Bulk upload file. Which Customer should this change impact?  All customers using the new Approval Workflow feature toggle. What pages should this change impact?  Company > Workflow > Approval Rules. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins. How should this change work? If there are any type of errors in the bulk upload file or processing failure, the system should show a red exclamation: Hovering on the icon should show a tooltip saying  Download Error Report . Clicking on the  Download Error Report  icon should download the error report. The system identifies the errors after processing the file : If there are invalid records in the columns of the approval rules bulk upload file, the system should mention them in the error report as per the existing standard of bulk upload error report. Please refer to the following pattern. Row# of the file. Header of the file (if missing all together) Issue(s) that causes the error. If there are multiple errors for a single row, all errors should be visible in a separate row. The Processing Failure : The system supports bulk upload file in .XLSX format. If the user tries to upload the file in a format the system does not support, there should be a processing failure report. The error report in the PDF should say \u201cInvalid file format. Kindly download the template and use that file format for bulk upload.\u201c If the user removes any required column from the bulk upload file or provides an invalid column name, the system should provide those details in the PDF error report. Each error should be accommodated in a separate row in case of multiple errors. Other types of Errors that can happen : Duplicate Rule Name with different Condition(s). Two rules with same combination of Condition(s). Two rules with overarching combination of Condition(s), like one rule has catch all condition that covers rule two\u2019s condition as well. Users without Approver role for PR, CR, and PRQ documents. Users without AP Approver role for Invoices and Memo documents. Invalid Condition(s) - Inactive or deleted accounting objects. Invalid Approver(s) - Inactive or deleted Approvers. Note: Create the Approval Rule Bulk Upload Error Report template similar to how it works for Users / Suppliers error report.

Regarding the Error Report icon, I agree that we should retain the icon until a new Bulk upload file has been uploaded .  (NEW - 3/28/2024) When a Bulk upload file is uploaded and the system detects error(s) in the file, an Error Report should be generated. Upon opening the Error Report, the Error Report icon should  persist  on the Approval Rule page, allowing the Admin to revisit the Error Report if necessary. The Error Report icon should  disappear  if a new Bulk upload file is uploaded  without  any error(s). If a new Bulk upload file is uploaded and error(s) are  detected , the Error Report icon should  refresh  with a new Error Report. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All.

Some Budgets in FAILED Status in processingResult: If there are budgets in the request that have a status of  FAILED , while others might be in  SUCCESS  status, the header-level status should be  COMPLETED_WITH_FAILURE . All Budgets in UN_CHANGED Status in processingResult: If all budgets in the request have a status of UNCHANGED, indicating that no changes were made, the header-level status should be  COMPLETED_WITH_WARNING .

Acceptance Criteria: Existing Implementation of adding item to PR via Bulk Upload: The user clicks the  Uplaod Item(s)  button from the PR screen. A window appears, where the user select the file from the system or clod storage. A push notification appears at the bottom right corner of the screen telling the user that the file is in progress. Line item(s) is added to the PR Line Item Grid if the file is processed without errors. The notification tells the user that the file is processed successfully. If the file is processed with errors, Line Item(s) is added to the PR with the errors. The notification tells the user that the file is processed with errors. There is a link. Clicking on that navigates the user with the newly created PR. There is another link. Clicking on that downloads the error report for the user. While Creating the PR, the system prioritizes the accounting and organization objects' values in the BOM file. The system checks the user\u2019s profile for accounting and organization objects' values if not found. If not found, the system leaves those fields empty.

        "description": "User Story: As an Admin , I want to use additional parameters to route my documents for approval  so that  we can ensure a 100% compliance with our business process and attain efficiency through the workflow automation. Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system supports the inclusion of additional Organization and Accounting fields in the workflow rules definition. 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true  and  the new workflow rules feature toggle = true. Important Notes:   The new workflow enhancements will only be enabled for Maersk and Forest Lawn initially. For all other customers for whom this will be turned off, the existing functionality will prevail (for both Vroozi Invoice and Purchase). 3.  What pages should this change impact?  The Company \u2192 Workflow page. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. Admin creates a new rule or updates an existing rule: When they add a new field under Condition(s)  or  click on an existing field\u2019s drop down, they are able to select any of the following new fields presented in the drop down: Note:  The Admin is able to select any of the below fields as the first condition. The system displays the  custom labels  of the below fields in the drop down if they\u2019ve been configured by the Admin. WBS Element,  if activated. Internal Order,  if activated. Profit Center,  if activated. Class,  if activated. Customer,  if activated. Purchasing organizations. Special Case (See below for more details) : Location Type,  if activated. Value :  The Admin is able to filter any  undeleted  and  active  values of the selected field. How NEW accounting elements should work  - All 4 Accounting Categories ( Cost Centers ,  WBS Elements ,  Internal Orders  and  Profit Centers ) should be available when a new Rule is created. Admin can  only  choose 1 Accounting Category in an Approval Rule, at a time. The other 3 Accounting Categories should become hidden so that the  Admin  cannot select these categories in the Field section later. Location Type   should be a field that can only be selected if - Location Type selected in the Approval Rule belongs to a Company Code that satisfies the below condition. Company Code has Location Type required = Yes. Classes  - Can be linked to Single, Multiple or All Company Codes. Purchasing Organizations  - Can be linked to Single or All Company Codes. Customers  - How is the Customer field field filtered on all documents? Lets keep the dependencies between the Customer and Company Code. GL Account and other Accounting Categories should be available based on the Company Code selected for this approval rule. Customer Data used by current clients in Production ( for reference ) - Client Company Code Accounting Categories GL Account Maersk Yes Yes Gradient Yes Delta Fuel Yes Ednovate Yes Custom Goods Yes Yes (sometimes individually) Yes (sometimes individually) ICE Yes USJ Yes Yes NBCU Yes Yes BAA Yes Search Filtering : Admin should be able to search for the new Accounting elements in the Search filter section. Narrow search by: WBS Element,  if activated. Internal Order,  if activated. Profit Center,  if activated. Class,  if activated. Customer,  if activated. Location Type,  if activated. Purchasing organizations. Workflow Rule matching : The system should consider  new  Accounting elements while matching documents ( such as Invoices, Memos, & Payment Requests ) . Please refer to this ticket for existing matching rule implementation that we are looking to develop in the Mini-Release (RC-2024-2.1.0) -   6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes, as new fields are being added to the workflow rules. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Potentially no. But existing workflow rules will be impacted as a result of AC #6. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date 1 5 Deepak October 20, 2023  /    # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 How is the Customer field field filtered on all documents? 2 When should we implement the BE validation logic to disallow more than one Accounting Categories  suggests to implement it as part of upload ticket      I would implement it as part of this ticket, so we already have the error, and re-use it in the bulk upload (Jimena) Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Should we support Purchasing Organizations? 2 Should we support Location Type? 3 Should we use the Default Class field in Location to filter Classes?

Criteria: A new feature toggle named \u2018 INTELLIGENCE__INVOICE_EXCEPTION_HANDLER \u2019 should be added to allow for this feature to be TURN ON/OFF at company level. If this feature is enabled, a new settings should be available in Accounts Payable > Settings > Preferences section, where admin can enable/disable this options for their company. Rename current ML settings to  Apply Machine Learning to invoice line-items   for coding New settings will be called Apply Machine Learning to invoice for exception handler If this new settings is disabled, there should be no changes to the current flow and no model endpoint should be called for prediction. If this new settings is enabled, During invoice processing, when there is an exception, the system should be able to make a call to model endpoint with provided mapping details and display appropriate resolution with confidence score to the user. AP Processor User should see new button as shown in the mock below to see the suggested exception resolution per line that has non-GR related exceptions which should be shown as follow. Clicking on the Suggest Resolution(s) button  should get the resolutions for non-GR related exceptions from Model Endpoint and display resolutions to AP Processor with confidence score.  AP Processor User should be able to see the confidence score by clicking on the bulb icon as shown below. Note: For the lightbulb icons, we will follow the current color scheme that we already use for Vroozi Intelligence: Blue - resolutions with >= 90% confidence Orange - resolutions with < 90% confidence However, if AP processor decides to submit the exceptions for manual exception handling by clicking on the Submit For Exception Handling button, the invoice should be moved to Exception state and Suggest Resolution(s) button should not longer be available for AP processor to avoid conflict in resolutions from AI/Manual process. After the Model suggested resolutions, AP processor should be able to either Accept or Reject resolutions by clicking on Reject/Accept button after the resolution has been provided. The confirmation dialog should be shown when user clicks on the Accept  button as it is today. The exceptions should be resolved after user clicks on Yes, Accept button and invoice should be moved to next step for Approval, whereas canceling should make no changes. If AP Processor User is not happy with the model suggested resolutions, he should be able to reject the resolution by clicking on Reject button before submitting it for manual exception handler. Upon rejecting, the invoice should be moved back to DRAFT and Submit For Exception Handling button should be available again. After rejection, AP processor should be able to see the Suggest Resolution(s) button again, along with Submit For Exceptin handling button and decide to either submit for manually exception handling or make modification to invoices and re-generate model suggested resolutions by clicking on Suggest Resolution button.  When invoice is submitted for manual exception handler, the exception handler should also be able to see the Suggest Resolution(s) button along with Bulb Icon showing all the model suggested resolutions with confidence for each exceptions. Clicking on the Suggest Resolution(s) button should then apply the top resolutions for each exception and a new Clear Resolution(s) button should appear. AP Exception Handler User should be able to clear suggested AI resolutions by clicking on Clear Resolution buttons. Exception Handler should be able to submit exception resolutions back to the AP Processor as it is today after resolutions is selected. Once the resolution is provided by Exception Handler, AP Processor should be able to Accept or Reject the resolutions (existing functionality) Scenarios   Note:  All the above flow should be applicable for all types of PO based invoices that contains non-GR exception including cXML invoices as well as auto invoice processing flow.",
