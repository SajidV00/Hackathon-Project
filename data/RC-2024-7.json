        "description": "Here's the context:  There's a new Vroozi client that is in the Go-live process Their go-live is now blocked due to a design flaw in our PR approval workflows This flaw permits fraudulent PR approvals, which opens up the client to legal liabilities Client's account config details:  They are using the new dynamic workflow engine They have certain users which have the  Employee  and  Approver  roles assigned The Admin has configured certain workflow rules in a way, that such an Employee's PR ends up with the requester themselves for approval.  This person can then potentially approve their own PR, thereby committing financial fraud.  Example scenario: The user (John Doe) has both Employee and Approver roles.  The user has a $10,000 spend limit, and a $100,000 Approval limit.  The user submits a PR for $60,000 The Approval Chain looks like  Approver 1 ($50,000) -> John Doe ($100,000) -> Approver 3 ($500,000) Currently, after the first approver's sign off, John Doe is assigned as the designated Approver on his own PR, as the system isn't built to detect this conflict. So John Doe ends up approving his own PR.  We need to solve this by ensuring that the PR skips John Doe in this case, and goes to Approver 3 instead for the next approval. Note:  The scope of the ticket is limited to the current Go Live Blocker of C&W. We just need to Fix this on the PR and CR document when the document is submitted. On the PR; the requester (Employee / Admin), and on the POCR; the person creating the CR (Employee / Admin / Buyer / Central Receiver) should be skipped from the Approval Chain. Sourcing, Budget Approval step will not require any change.",

Enter Mandatory data other than Data in accounting section. Select a Company Code. Select an available Budget which does not have any accounting object of the selected Company Code. E.g, select a Budget with GL account which is not linked to the selected Company Code. Now in the GL Account field, select the GL which is available in the menu. Actual Result: Budget is not getting reset as a different GL account has been selected than the one which is in the Budget. Note: This needs to be fixed for other fields as well of the accounting section. Expected Result: Budget should get reset if the field other than the one mentioned in the Budget is selected from Accounting and Company Info section.

On line item modal, incorrect Budget is being saved. On line item grid no error for missing Budget is displayed once saved is clicked on the Add line item modal.

For example, If the admin tries to update the budget amount, change the budget duration, add a new accounting string, or change the system\u2019s behavior when the budget is averaged. When the user clicks the  SAVE  button to update the budget with an invalid accounting string, the system should display a red Noty message from the left side of the screen. The red Noty message should read: \"This budget cannot be updated because the associated accounting string contains an invalid accounting/organization object(s). Please update the budget after replacing the invalid accounting/organization object.\"  The Noty message should be a slider. It should stay on the screen for 3 to 5 seconds and then slide away. If the user hovers over the Noty message, it should remain visible as long as the user continues to hover over it. There should be an X icon on the top right corner of the Noty message.

That new screen should allow the user to associate the accounting string with any combination of accounting and organization objects. The label of the modal should be\u00a0  Associate Accounting String. There should be two sections on the  Associate Accounting String  modal: Company Info. This section should contain the following fields Company Code.  (type ahead field) Purchasing Org . (type ahead field) Plant  (type ahead field) If any object from the above list is off for the unit ID, the system should not show that field on this modal. (Existing functionality and should be extended to this new  Associate Accounting String  modal) All the objects having custom labels should be visible with their custom labels.\u00a0 Accounting Info. This section should contain the following fields: Accounting Category  (Drop Down) This dropdown should appear if at least one of the cost objects is ON for the unitID. The system should not show this drop-down if no cost object is ON for the unitID. There should be the following options in the drop-down based on how many of them are ON for the unitID Cost Center WBS Internal Order Profit Center Selecting any option from the above list should show that field beneath the  Accounting Category . Cost Object  (type ahead) The label should appear based on the selected option from the  Accounting Category  dropdown.\u00a0 GL Account  (type ahead) Customer  (type ahead) Class  (type ahead) Project  (type ahead) Location Type  (type ahead) Location  (type ahead) If any  Accounting Object  from the above list is off for the unit ID, the system should not show that field on this modal. (Existing functionality and should be extended to this new  Associate Accounting String  modal) All the objects having custom labels should be visible with their custom labels.\u00a0 According to the existing logic, the system should fetch Accounting Objects in the type ahead. The existing logic is the objects are generally fetched based on their pairing with the Company Code in the Accounting Master Data. The  Customer  is fetched based on their pairing with the\u00a0 Company Code, Cost Object, GL Account, and Project in the Accounting Master Data. The  Location  is fetched based on their paring with the Company Code, Location Type, Plant, and Class in the Accounting Master Data. The Cost Object dictates the Company Code selection If the  Dictate Via Company Code  toggle is OFF based on their paring in the Accounting Master Data.\u00a0 In this case, The placement of  Company Info  and  Accounting Info  sections should be flipped. (As happens on Line Item Modal) There should be the following buttons on the bottom of the  Associate Accounting String  screen while associating a new accounting string: (Please note that the following button should only handle the Accounting String association/removal with the budget. The complete budget object can be saved only from the main budget definition modal) Add this Accounting String  button(In the mockup, it is depicted as a  Save  button) It should remain disabled until the user fills in at least one field from the  Company  or  Accounting Info  section. Add this Accounting String  button color should be blue. Once at least one field from the  Company  or  Accounting Info  section has value, the  Add this Accounting String  button should become enabled.\u00a0 Clicking the  Add this Accounting String  button should associate the  Accounting String  with the  Budget . The  Associate Accounting String  modal should slide to the right\u00a0 The main  Budget  screen should slide in from the left. The newly associated Accounting String should be listed in the  Associate this budget with  section. Remove this Accounting String  button(In the mockup, it is depicted as a  Cancel  button) Clicking that should not associate the Accounting String with the budget. In case editing the existing accounting string, clicking the  Remove this Accounting String  button will remove the association of the Accounting String with the budget. The  Associate Accounting String  screen should slide to the right\u00a0 The main  Budget  screen should slide in from the left. There should be the following two navigation icons on the top corners of the  Associate Accounting String  screen: X  icon: Clicking on that should close the budget definition modal. (existing behavior) |<-  icon: If nothing has been entered on the  Associate Accounting String  screen, the system should simply navigate the user to the main budget definition screen. If some information has been provided on the  Associate Accounting String  screen, the system should display the yellow message and buttons as shown in the mockup. Clicking  Save changes & go back  should associate the accounting string with the budget and navigate the user to the main budget definition screen. (i.e. the  Associate Accounting String  screen should slide away to the right and from the left, the main budget definition screen should appear.) Clicking  Go back without saving changes  should not associate the accounting string with the budget and navigate the user to the main budget definition screen.\u00a0 In the case of editing the existing accounting screen, clicking the  Go back without saving changes  button should not associate the updated accounting string with the budget. The system should keep the older version of the accounting string. In case of a duplicate Accounting String being associated with the Budgets, the system should show a noty message.\u00a0 Currently, the noty message appears when the user adds a duplicate string on the Create/Edit Budget modal. Now, the system should display that same noty message when the user tries to add a duplicate string by clicking the  Save  button from the Associate Accounting String modal. Any change in the accounting string on the  Associate Accounting String  modal should be captured in the Budget Audit Trail. Impacted Users: Admin Budget Approver(With Create and/or Edit rights)",

      "description": "Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( \u2014 ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline. Success Criteria: Effective implementation of T&Cs management and assignment system enhancements. Improved flexibility and control for Admins and Buyers in handling T&Cs. Seamless integration with existing systems and processes. Positive feedback from primary stakeholders, Yukon and Maersk. Milestones: MVP - Minimum Viable Product: Product manager to validate assumptions and solution design with stakeholders. Engineering to complete    MUP - Minimum Useable Product:                                     Purchase Order: Allow Buyers to create and associate Ad-hoc T&Cs to a specific PO Purchase Order: Print the correct T&Cs on the PO PDF Vroozi Admin: Allow Admins to specify whether PO T&Cs can be updated via the POCR function POCR: Allow only the \u201cPO Owner\u201d to update T&Cs via POCR POCR: Record and display T&Cs changes done on a PO, in the PO Document Change History Integration team  \u2192 SPIKE: Integration team needs to investigate impact on NBCU, if T&Cs can be updated vai POCR Payables team  \u2192 Supplier Portal: Display PO T&Cs in the Vroozi Supplier Portal Payables team  \u2192 Supplier Portal: Ensure SP users are able to Confirm / Dispute T&Cs changes on a PO updated via POCR MLP - Minimum Lovable Product: Vroozi Admin: Figure out how to introduce an \u201cApply to All\u201d option for associations SPIKE: Investigate how we can compute, store and display a fine grained \u201cDiff\u201d for the T&Cs content, when updated by an Admin         Integration team  \u2192     POCR: Allow Admins to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Allow Central Reciever to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Ensure that T&Cs updates on POs; done via POCR, are reviewed and approved by the \u201cPO Owner\u201d Vroozi PMAN: Allow Buyers, Admins, Central Receivers to create custom T&Cs and save them in their user profile for reuse at a later date Vroozi PMAN: Allow users to view and manage their custom T&Cs from their \u201cMy Data\u201d screen \u00a0 The wireframes for this project can also be found here:",

Then we created a PO  so now there is no TermsAndConditions Id attached to PO now If a POCR is performed in this scenario we don\u2019t have to show a section ? But now If we select CUSTOM from  Terms and Conditions Select dropDown  then go for a POCR now we able to assign custom T&Cs ? \u00a0On the POCR screen, when deciding what to show in the T&Cs section, there are 2 conditions that need to be evaluated:  What T&Cs information is present in the source PO? What is the current set of configurations, at the time the Buyer is doing the POCR?  If the source PO does not have any T&Cs data in it, and the unitID is currently configured to not use any T&Cs, then the system should NOT display the T&Cs section on POCR screen.  If the source PO does not have any T&Cs data in it, and the unitID is currently configured to use the default T&Cs, then the system should NOT display the T&Cs section on POCR screen. If the source PO does not have any T&Cs data in it, and the unitID is currently configured to use custom T&Cs, then the system should show the T&Cs section with the taxt \u201c There aren\u2019t any Terms & Conditions assigned to this Purchase Order currently. \u201c Whether there will be a type-ahead, or a button to create Ad-hoc T&Cs will depend on the current user\u2019s permissions.  If the source PO has T&Cs assigned to it, and the unitID is currently configured to not use any T&Cs, then the system should display the T&Cs section on the POCR screen, but in read-only mode.

        "description": "This ticket MUST be released along with:     Business Case: Following the updates done in   and  , a key element is missing: the ability to apply split accounting assignments to selected line items. This enhancement aims to provide users with the ability to assign accounting splits based on quantity, value, or percent using the new Apply to All modal. We also want to enabled users to define presets with split accounting from the \u201cManage Presets\u201d tab, and then use them from the \u201cChanges to be Applied\u201d tab. Acceptance Criteria: Note : The behavior described in this ticket MUST work consistently on all line items, regardless of how they were added to the document: Manually via the \u201c Add Item \u201d function. Created via  OCR . Created via  cXML . Created via  Supplier Portal . Which Customer should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, if memos are enabled. What pages should this change impact?  Invoice and Memo documents. Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Processor, AP Manager, AP Coder, AP Approver with coding access, Employee/Buyer with coding access, Admin. How should this change work? UI Enhancement: A new field labeled \"Split Account Assignment\" should be added to the Accounting section of the Apply to All modal. The new field should have the following options: <blank>, \"None\", \"By Quantity\", \"By Value\", \"By Percent\", with <blank> as the default. Functionality for <Blank>: By default, the <blank> option should be selected. Selecting this option should maintain the current UI state. Upon application, the system should NOT make any changes to the split accounting status of the selected items. Instead, any fields which have values specified in them, should be updated across all the available accounting segments of all the selected line items. Functionality for 'None': Selecting \"None\" should maintain the current UI state. Upon application, the system should overwrite existing split accounting segments with the new data provided, making all fields in the Accounting section required. Functionality for 'By Quantity': Selecting \"By Quantity\" should dynamically add at least two sets of accounting fields. Users should be able to add additional sets of identical fields. A required field labeled \"Quantity #1\", \"Quantity #2\", etc., should be added to each set. Upon application, the system should overwrite existing split accounting segments with the new data provided, making all fields in the Accounting section required. Functionality for 'By Value': Selecting \"By Value\" should replicate the functionality of \"By Quantity\", replacing \"Quantity #n\" with \"Value #n\" fields. Functionality for 'By Percent': Selecting \"By Percent\" should replicate the functionality of \"By Quantity\", replacing \"Quantity #n\" with \"Percent #n\" fields. Application of Changes: The system should evaluate if the user's specified changes are compatible with each pre-selected line item. Compatibility for split accounting by  quantity  will be determined by comparing the sum of the quantities specified by the user, across all accounting segments, to the total order quantity of the selected line item. Compatible: If the two values  are equal , then the change can be applied. Incompatible: If the two values  are not equal , then the changes can be applied with a warning message within the \u201cyellow\u201d panel ( following existing system behavior for Invoice / Memo documents ). Compatibility for split accounting by  value  will be determined by comparing the sum of the values specified by the user, across all accounting segments, to the total order value of the selected line item.  Compatible: If the two values  are equal , then the change can be applied. Incompatible: If the two values  are not equal , then the changes can be applied with a warning message within the \u201cyellow\u201d panel ( following existing system behavior for Invoice / Memo documents ). Compatibility for split accounting by  percent  will be determined by comparing the sum of the percentages specified by the user, across all accounting segments. Compatible: If this sum adds up to \u201c 100 \u201d, then the change can be applied. Incompatible: If the sum  does not  add up to \u201c 100 \u201d or is above \u201c 100 \u201d, then the changes can be applied with a warning message within the \u201cyellow\u201d panel ( following existing system behavior for Invoice / Memo documents ). Error Notification: If any of the user\u2019s selected items were updated with incompatible quantity, value or percent, and the reason for that was related to the split accounting that the user was trying to apply, then the system should display a persistent notification on the UI, informing the user about which items had incompatible values and providing a clear explanation of why they were incompatible. ( following existing system behavior for Invoice / Memo documents ). This message should be displayed on screen using the pattern for document level warning messages; within the \u201c yellow \u201d panel. If the user was trying to apply split accounting by  quantity , this message should highlight the line item number # with a warning message saying - \u201c Total split quantity not adding up to '<1>'   \u201c. If the user was trying to apply split accounting by  value , this message should highlight the line item number # with a warning message saying - \u201c Total split value not adding up to \u2018<2>\u2019   \u201c. If the user was trying to apply split accounting by  percent , this message should highlight the line item number # with a warning message saying - \u201c Total split percentage not adding up to 100% \u201c. < 1 > :   Line item quantity . < 2 > :   Line item total . Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams.

Additionally, Our system does not; currently, natively support many-to-many relationships between company info & accounting info master data objects. Many customers have worked around this limitation by creating duplicate accounting elements, each of which is connected to a different parent element.

Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Processor, AP Manager, AP Coder, AP Approver with coding access, Employee/Buyer with coding access, Admin. How should this change work? Apply to All Functionality: There should be a \"Apply to All\" button in the application's user interface. This button should NOT be visible to any Employee / Buyer user that has coding restrictions enabled in their user record. The user can select one or more items before clicking the \"Apply to All\" button. Clicking the \"Apply to All\" button should open a modal dialog containing a dynamic form with multiple input fields. This modal should only show fields for the Org / Accounting elements that are enabled in the unitID. By default, all input fields in the modal should be blank. All input fields in the modal should be optional for the user to fill in. The system should only allow a user to set values in these fields that are currently \u201c_not deleted_\u201d and active in the unitID. Parent-Child Relationship: Some fields in the modal are considered parent elements, and others are considered child elements. If a user fills in a parent field, the system should restrict the user to selecting values in the child fields that are linked to the selected value in the parent field. This filtering mechanism must be driven off of the parent-child relationship of these elements in the unitID\u2019s master data If a parent field has only one possible value for a child field, that value should be automatically filled in by the system. Mandatory Child Fields: If the user fills in a parent field, the system must make it mandatory for the user to fill in all linked child fields before allowing the changes to be applied to the selected items. Validation and Notification: Note: The requirements documented below mean that either the user\u2019s entire set of specified changes will be applied to the line item, or nothing will be updated. There will not be a scenario where the user specifies changes to \u201c n \u201d child fields, but the system only updates some fraction of those \u201c n \u201d fields; as they were the only ones that would be valid with the existing parent field values on the line item. In this scenario, the entire set of specified changes will be discarded, and the user will be shown the appropriate error message. If the user is only updating child fields, the system should allow the user to apply changes. During the application of changes, the system must evaluate each selected item to determine if the user's specified change can work with the values already provided in the selected item's parent fields. If a user's specified change is incompatible with the existing parent field values, that item should remain unchanged. The system should display a persistent notification on the UI, informing the user about which items were not updated and providing a clear explanation of why they were not updated. This message should be displayed on screen using the pattern for document level warning messages; within the \u201c*yellow*\u201d panel.

If there are multiple items in the list, but they\u2019re not consecutive, the system should list the index numbers of all those items separated by commas, with the last item in that list being separated by an \u201c* and *\u201d.

What pages should this change impact?  The invoice and memos line items. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who have to access the Invoice / Memo document. How should this change work? For line item fields that can be enabled/disabled in the unitID, via the Admin panel: Each field\u2019s presence in the list of columns in the grid configuration menu, should be based on whether that field is enabled for the current unitID or not. If the field/master data object is disabled in the unitID, it  SHOULD NOT BE  listed as an option in the grid configuration menu If the field/master data object is enabled in the unitID, it  SHOULD BE  listed as an option in the grid configuration menu The list of master data objects covered by this requirement is as follows: Purchasing Organization ( Based on feature toggle implementation done in this ticket  -  ) Account Category Cost Center WBS Element Internal Order Profit Center GL Accounts Customer Project Class Location Location Type Reference :  Purchase Team\u2019s original implementation -    Do we need a data fix for existing customers?

What pages should this change impact?  The invoice and memos line items. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who have to access the Invoice / Memo document. How should this change work? To the grid configuration menu, add a new option in the list of available columns: This new option should be titled \u201c Account Category \u201c. This option should be listed after \u201c Plant \u201d option. This option should be disabled by default. Users should be able to turn this on if they wish to do so. If the user chooses to enable the Accounting Category column: This column should show the Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order / Profit Center that\u2019s actually assigned to the line item. Along with the Accounting object code + Name, the column should list the type of the accounting object assigned to the line item. E.g. If the line item has cost center \"100 - Marketing\" assigned to it, the UI should list it in the column as: Cost Center: 100 - Marketing Reference :  Purchase Team\u2019s original implementation -    Do we need a data fix for existing customers?

        "description": "Business Case: Users should be given the ability to add/remove columns from the Invoice/Memo line item grid. We need to update the grid in a way where we can enable Vroozi to continue enhancing this grid in the future. Acceptance Criteria: Which Customer should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true (and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, if memos are enabled). What pages should this change impact?  The invoice and memos line items. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who have to access the Invoice / Memo document. How should this change work? General rules for the line item grid: If a certain column does not have any data to display, it should just show up as \u201cN/A\u201d in the grid for that column. The user should  NEVER  be able to remove the following columns from the grid: Item selection Checkbox # Line item number Description Price Qty Total Action Grid configuration control column (gear icon) If the user adds more columns than can be displayed on the UI, the system should allow the user to scroll horizontally; within the grid, to view the additional columns. If the user chooses to show any Company Info or Accounting related columns on the grid, the UI should display both the code & name for that field\u2019s value; from the line item. Default state of the line item grid: By default, the line item grid should continue showing the same set of columns as it does today: Item selection Checkbox # Line item number Description GL Account Price Qty Tax Total This column header should continue to display the same help tip: Total excludes 'Tax', 'Discount' and \"Shipping Charges\" Action <Gear icon> Allow users to update which columns are included in the line item grid: The user should be able to click on the <gear icon> Doing so will display a drop-down menu to the user; similar to the grid configuration menu on the Draft PR / Track \u2018All\u2019 Invoices screens. This menu should have a Blue header component. This menu item should be titled \u201c Column Preferences \u201c. This menu should have a search box, titled \u201c Find a column \u2026 \u201c. The user should be able to lookup a specific column by entering its name in this field. This field should auto-filter the list of columns, as the user types. The system should match the user\u2019s entered text, with the column name from left to right. There is no need for token based matching. ( Ask Naufil for clarification about this ) The matching logic should be case insensitive. This menu should have a clickable link in it; under the search box, titled \u201c Restore Defaults \u201c. Clicking this should undo any modifications that the user has done to the checked/unchecked status of the individual options in the list, and restore the list to the user\u2019s default preferences. This menu should have a list of columns that can be included in the line item grid. This list should have the following options: # (line item number) Type Description GL Account (  I moved the GL here, so we keep it in the same order) Price Quantity Category Tax Code Discount Shipping Charges Tax UoM Company Code Purchasing Organization ( ) Plant Account Category ( ) Customer ( ) Project ( ) Class ( ) Location ( ) Location Type ( ) Total (   I\u2019ve added the total here that was missing) Allow the user to apply their desired changes to the line item grid: Once the user has made their selections, they can either click on either the \u201c Cancel \u201d or \u201c Done \u201d buttons in this menu. If the user clicks on the \u201c Cancel \u201d button: none of the user\u2019s changes will be applied to the line item grid. The grid configuration menu will automatically close. If the user clicks on the \u201c Done \u201d button: The user\u2019s specified changes will be applied to the line item grid. These changes should be saved, and used every time the user opens up the invoice/memo document. The grid configuration menu will automatically close.

        "description": "Business Case: The system should run the accounting string validations at the  Apply to All  modal. Acceptance Criteria: General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Creation: Currently, the system requires the definition of the required and optional Accounting/Organization objects in the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service . If the value in the optional field is given at the line item, the system considers it for the accounting validation in addition to the required fields. If the value in the optional field is not given for the line item, the system considers only the values in the required fields for the accounting validation. Based on that, the system decided what fields should be compared in the accounting validation with the accounting string master data. Accounting Validation on Apply to All modal: Changes to be Applied tab: On the  Changes to be Applied  tab, there are two ways to fill in the fields: Select the  preset. Select the values individually. Once the user has provided value in any or all fields required/optional for accounting validation and clicks the  Apply Changes  button, the system should run the accounting validation for the line items selected for the Apply to All.  The  Apply Changes  button labels should be changed to  Validating Data  with the in-process icon. ( refer to the Document Submit button ) The Apply to All modal should disappear if no accounting errors are found. The selected line items should be updated accordingly. The Apply to All modal should disappear if accounting errors are found. The selected line items should be updated accordingly. The accounting validation error message should appear above the line item grid on the document stating the line items selected for Apply to All and their invalid accounting strings. The user can go further to the line item individually to rectify the accounting string issue. The following Red highlighted section is not required at this point. On the  Changes to be Applied  tab, there are two ways to fill in the fields: Select the  preset. Select the values individually. The system should run the accounting validation as soon as it finds values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  on the  Changes to be Applied  tab of the  Apply to All  modal. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system green message. The message should disappear in 3 seconds. If the system finds the accounting string errors, the system should show the following message This message should persist until the user resolves the issue. The system should run the accounting validation as soon as it finds values in all the required and optional fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service Changes to be Applied  tab of the  Apply to All  modal. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system green message. The message should disappear in 3 seconds. If the system finds the accounting string errors, the system should show the following message This message should persist until the user resolves the issue. The error message should be as follows when the line item is not split. Accounting String Error  The following Accounting String has been deactivated  \u2192 Error Code 02 The following Accounting String is not valid (does not exist)  \u2192 Error Code 01 Company Code = <Code> - <Description> Plant Code = <Code> - <Description> Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order = <Code> - <Description> GL Account = <Code> - <Description> \u2026 (display the rest of the elements in the same order the line items in separate lines) There should be a separate error message for each invalid accounting string associated with different splits on the  Changes to be Applied  tab of the  Apply to All  modal. The following is the pattern of the error message that should be followed: Accounting String Error - split #\u2026  \u2192 Display all splits of the item containing that Accounting String The following Accounting String has been deactivated  \u2192 Error Code 02 The following Accounting String is not valid (does not exist)  \u2192 Error Code 01 Company Code = <Code> - <Description> Plant Code = <Code> - <Description> Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order = <Code> - <Description> GL Account = <Code> - <Description> \u2026 (display the rest of the elements in the same order the line items in separate lines) The message should read \u201cAccounting String Error - split # (comma separated).\u201c. The message should read \u201cAccounting String Error - split # (- separated).\u201c in case of splits in the sequence has the same accounting string error. After the message should tell the user why the selected accounting string combination of the mentioned line items was marked invalid. Either the string was deactivated. Or the string does not exist in Vroozi Master Data. The message should display the associated accounting combination with the mentioned splits in the strings. Please review the error message on the documents above the line item grid. The system should keep the  Apply Changes  button disabled until the accounting validation error message persists. Please note that the R&D done so far does not show any instance in which a certain accounting object is required in the accounting configuration service and is optional on the line item modal.  So making this the basis for our assumption, we can say that the above-scenario can happen technically but not practically. QA can run such scenarios in their testing activity.  If there is any custom accounting validation error message that exits, it should also be visible on the Apply to All modal with the main message. (refer to  )  All AC points mentioned above should be implemented for the following documents where users can access the  Apply to All  Modal. PR CR PO Create PO Wizard POCR All AC points mentioned above should be implemented for the following users who can take action on the documents listed above. Admin Requester Sourcing Approver (with Editing rights) Financial Approver (with Coding rights) Buyer Central Receiver Any other user( QA: Please do the impact analysis and let me know If I have missed any user ) Manage Presets: All the acceptance criteria mentioned in the  Changes to be Applied tab  should be implemented for the  Manage Presets  tab of the  Apply  to All modal. On selecting the existing preset on the Manage Presets tab, the system should not run accounting validation until the user changes values in the fields required for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  on the  Manage Presets  tab of the  Apply to All  modal. Testing Strategy: ,  , Kindly document the testing Strategy here in the panel that how the team is going to cover all the mentioned documents and users while testing the Accounting Validation at  Apply to All  Modal.",
