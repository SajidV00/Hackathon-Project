This occurs for invoices that are created by the system, such as through cXML or OCR. Solution : If the invoice is automatically created by the system using cXML or OCR, then the system should check - Are there any WF matches? If yes, then use that WF group.

      "description": "Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( \u2014 ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline. Success Criteria: Effective implementation of T&Cs management and assignment system enhancements. Improved flexibility and control for Admins and Buyers in handling T&Cs. Seamless integration with existing systems and processes. Positive feedback from primary stakeholders, Yukon and Maersk. Milestones: MVP - Minimum Viable Product: Product manager to validate assumptions and solution design with stakeholders. Engineering to complete    MUP - Minimum Useable Product:                                     Purchase Order: Allow Buyers to create and associate Ad-hoc T&Cs to a specific PO Purchase Order: Print the correct T&Cs on the PO PDF Vroozi Admin: Allow Admins to specify whether PO T&Cs can be updated via the POCR function POCR: Allow only the \u201cPO Owner\u201d to update T&Cs via POCR POCR: Record and display T&Cs changes done on a PO, in the PO Document Change History Integration team  \u2192 SPIKE: Integration team needs to investigate impact on NBCU, if T&Cs can be updated vai POCR Payables team  \u2192 Supplier Portal: Display PO T&Cs in the Vroozi Supplier Portal Payables team  \u2192 Supplier Portal: Ensure SP users are able to Confirm / Dispute T&Cs changes on a PO updated via POCR MLP - Minimum Lovable Product: Vroozi Admin: Figure out how to introduce an \u201cApply to All\u201d option for associations SPIKE: Investigate how we can compute, store and display a fine grained \u201cDiff\u201d for the T&Cs content, when updated by an Admin         Integration team  \u2192     POCR: Allow Admins to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Allow Central Reciever to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Ensure that T&Cs updates on POs; done via POCR, are reviewed and approved by the \u201cPO Owner\u201d Vroozi PMAN: Allow Buyers, Admins, Central Receivers to create custom T&Cs and save them in their user profile for reuse at a later date Vroozi PMAN: Allow users to view and manage their custom T&Cs from their \u201cMy Data\u201d screen \u00a0 The wireframes for this project can also be found here:",

        "description": "Business Case: The functionality being built under   will allow company administrators to create and manage multiple sets of Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) that can be associated with Purchase Orders (POs) based on specific parameters (Company Code and Supplier). To streamline operations and ensure that every PO is sent out with the correct set of T&Cs without manual intervention, we need to enable the system to automatically assign the appropriate T&Cs to POs when they are manually generated by an Admin or Buyer. This enhancement is crucial for maintaining compliance, ensuring that all transactions are governed by the correct legal frameworks, and enhancing user satisfaction by automating a critical aspect of the procurement process. We will also need t oupdate how assigned T&Cs are displayed on the DRAFT PO, in order to improve the UX.  Acceptance Criteria: Pre-requisites: The feature flag defined in   must be enabled for the unitID. The unitID should be configured to use the \u201cCustom Terms & Conditions\u201d option on the  Admin Panel \u2192 Documents \u2192 Purchase Orders  screen.

PMAN Admin ( when creating a PO ) PMAN Buyer Data-Fix Necessity Will there be any requirement for data migration or transformation as part of this change? TBD \u2026 If required, please provide details of what the expected effect of this data fix will be: TBD \u2026 \u00a0 What triggers the association of T&Cs with a PO? An Admin or a Buyer manually creating a PO via either the \u201cCreate PO\u201d wizard, or the \u201cReady for Sourcing\u201d screen. The T&C assignment should happen once the DRAFT PO has been generated by the system, but before the user lands on the DRAFT PO screen. \u00a0 How does the system determine which set of T&Cs to assign to a PO? By checking if the PO's Company Code and Supplier match those associated with a set of active T&Cs. The system should first try and fetch active T&Cs that have specified associations, that are an exact match for the Company Code + Supplier combination on the PO document. if no such T&Cs are found, then the system should try and fetch T&Cs that only have either Company Codes, or Suppliers specified in their associations, and the POs Company Code or Supplier match with those specified associations on the T&Cs. If a matching set of T&Cs is found: The system assigns this set of T&Cs to the PO. If multiple matching sets of T&Cs are found: The system assigns the first set from this list of T&Cs, to the PO. If no specific match is found: The system assigns the default set of T&Cs to the PO. In the case of the default T&Cs having specific Company Code and Supplier associations: The system treats the default T&Cs as universally applicable, ignoring any specific associations. \u00a0 What should the system do if there is only one set of T&Cs in the system without specific associations? The system automatically assigns this universal set of T&Cs to the PO. QA needs to test this with the Ad-hoc output flows. The PO document needs to store which T&Cs have been applied to it. Because we have to display them on the UI. So the PO needs to show whatever the state of the T&Cs was when the PO was sent to the vendor. \u00a0 How should the auto-assigned T&Cs be displayed on a DRAFT PO? The system should continue showing the assigned T&Cs on the DRAFT PO, exactly where they\u2019re displayed today. Towards the bottom of the document, above the action buttons.  The T&Cs section should ONLY be visible if there are T&Cs assigned to the PO.  The height of the T&Cs section should be capped, to be the same as the adjacent \u201cNotes to Supplier\u201d section.  The T&Cs section should be titled \u201cTerms & Conditions\u201d This section should display the unique name of the assigned T&Cs  This section should display the content of the assigned T&Cs If the content doesn\u2019t fit into the fixed height of this section, it should be truncated and the body of text should end with an ellipsis ( \u2026 ), so the user understands that there is more content.  \u00a0 When should the system display a \u201cShow more \u2026\u201d link in the T&Cs section? If the T&Cs section is showing truncated content, then there should be a \u201cShow more \u2026\u201d link below the body of text.  Whether or not this link is visible, should NOT affect the total height of the T&Cs section.  This link should be clickable by the user.  \u00a0 What should the user see when they click on the \u201cShow more \u2026\u201d link? When the user clicks on the \u201cShow more \u2026\u201d link, the system should display a modal to the user.

The implementation of a background service designed to capture and log every modification to the custom T&Cs within a unitID was completed in  . This ticket builds on top of that, and adds the ability to track when the unitID default T&Cs are changed: By systematically recording who made change, when this change was made, the method used for the changes (API, bulk upload, UI), the organization can ensure a higher level of compliance with internal policies and external regulatory requirements. This comprehensive change log will serve as an essential tool for audits, offering a clear trail of modifications for accountability and verification purposes. Additionally, in instances of errors or disputes regarding the custom T&Cs, having a detailed history of this change can expedite resolution. By identifying when such a change was made and by whom, it is easier to trace back through the decision-making process, understand the context of the modifications, and, if necessary, correct an error or address a dispute more efficiently. Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: If the feature flag added in   has not been removed from the system. Then the unitID MUST have this feature flag enabled. The data table defined in   must have already been developed, so that any custom T&Cs that are created, can be displayed in it.

        "description": "Business Case: The functionality being built under   will allow company administrators to create and manage multiple sets of Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) that can be associated with Purchase Orders (POs) based on specific parameters (Company Code and Supplier). To streamline operations and ensure that every PO is sent out with the correct set of T&Cs without manual intervention, we need to enable the system to automatically assign the appropriate T&Cs to POs during their auto-generation process. This enhancement is crucial for maintaining compliance, ensuring that all transactions are governed by the correct legal frameworks, and enhancing user satisfaction by automating a critical aspect of the procurement process. Acceptance Criteria: Pre-requisites: The feature flag defined in   must be enabled for the unitID. The unitID should be configured to use the \u201cCustom Terms & Conditions\u201d option on the  Admin Panel \u2192 Documents \u2192 Purchase Orders  screen.  The system should already allow creation and management of multiple T&Cs, as well as allowing a default set of T&Cs to be designated for the unitID.\u00a0As defined in:          Impacted Vroozi Roles Which user roles within the Vroozi Admin system will be affected by this change? PMAN Admin ( when creating and submitting a PR ) PMAN Employee Data-Fix Necessity Will there be any requirement for data migration or transformation as part of this change? TBD \u2026 If required, please provide details of what the expected effect of this data fix will be: TBD \u2026 What triggers the association of T&Cs with a PO? The system's auto-generation of a PO upon approval of a purchase request. How does the system determine which set of T&Cs to assign to a PO? By checking if the PO's Company Code and Supplier match those associated with a set of active T&Cs. The system should first try and fetch active T&Cs that have specified associations, that are an exact match for the Company Code + Supplier combination on the PO document.  if no such T&Cs are found, then the system should try and fetch T&Cs that only have either Company Codes, or Suppliers specified in their associations, and the POs Company Code or Supplier match with those specified associations on the T&Cs.  If a matching set of T&Cs is found: The system assigns this set of T&Cs to the PO. If multiple matching sets of T&Cs are found: The system assigns the first set from this list of T&Cs, to the PO. If no specific match is found: The system assigns the default set of T&Cs to the PO. In the case of the default T&Cs having specific Company Code and Supplier associations: The system treats the default T&Cs as universally applicable, ignoring any specific associations. What should the system do if there is only one set of T&Cs in the system without specific associations? The system automatically assigns this universal set of T&Cs to the PO. QA needs to test this with the Ad-hoc output flows.  The PO document needs to store which T&Cs have been applied to it. Because we have to display them on the UI. So the PO needs to show whatever the state of the T&Cs was when the PO was sent to the vendor.  When returning multiple T&Cs from the BE, the system should sort the returned results based on creation date in ASC order.  \u00a0 Question Answer Q asked by \u2026 Q asked on \u2026 A provided by \u2026 A provided on \u2026",

Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  User settings in Master Data will be re-organized by splitting the interface into two distinct tabs: ' BASIC INFO ' and ' DELEGATION INFO '. Previously, the User settings were presented in a single section without tabs, which contained all user-specific data. This change will create a more structured and navigable layout. Which Customer should this change impact?  All customers. What pages should this change impact?  Master Data > Users. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins. How should this change work? Introduce 2 tabs in the User settings: BASIC INFO. DELEGATION INFO. BASIC INFO  should contain all the existing user settings such as: Basic Information. Roles. Dashboard. Approval Settings. Productions (SDM) My System Defaults. Access. Document Defaults. BASIC INFO  tab should always be the 1st accessible tab when the Admin opens the user\u2019s profile. Reference  -  You can check how the supplier records have been designed in Master Data > Suppliers section for inspiration . DELEGATION INFO  tab should contain the Out Of Office (OOO) settings that an Admin can control: Re-use the OOO settings layout that we use in the Approver\u2019s profile into the Delegation Info section (if possible). The implementation for the OOO settings will be done in this ticket -    Footer buttons  should be consistent and visible on both the BASIC INFO & DELEGATION INFO tab. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  Purchase Team. Questions : Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date Should we change the \u201c Going to vacation? \u201d text on the Admin view side settings? Yes, we should change the \u201c Going to Vacation text \u201d on the Admin view side. Some suggestions are -  \u201c Adjust Out of Office Settings \u201d \u201c Modify Vacation Settings \u201d \"Configure Out of Office\" I am leaning towards the 1st option but please feel free to provide your suggestion(s). \u00a0  /    \u00a05/6/2024 \u00a0   \u00a05/7/2024",

Acceptance Criteria: General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Creation: Currently, the system requires the definition of the required and optional Accounting/Organization objects in the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service .

If the value in the optional field is not given at the line item, the system considers only the values in the required fields at the line item for the accounting validation. Based on that, the system decided what fields should be compared in the accounting validation with the accounting string master data. Accounting Validation at Line Item: The system should run the accounting validation as soon as it finds values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  on the line item modal. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system green message. The message should disappear in 3 seconds. If the system finds the accounting string errors, the system should show the following message This message should persist until the user resolves the issue.

The following is the pattern of the error message that should be followed: Accounting String Error - split #\u2026  \u2192 Display all splits of the item containing that Accounting String The following Accounting String has been deactivated  \u2192 Error Code 02 The following Accounting String is not valid (does not exist)  \u2192 Error Code 01 Company Code = <Code> - <Description> Plant Code = <Code> - <Description> Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order = <Code> - <Description> GL Account = <Code> - <Description> \u2026 (display the rest of the elements in the same order the line items in separate lines) The message should read \u201cAccounting String Error - split # (comma separated).\u201c. The message should read \u201cAccounting String Error - split # (- separated).\u201c in case of splits in the sequence has the same accounting string error. The message should tell the user why the selected accounting string combination of the mentioned line items was marked invalid. Either the string was deactivated. Or the string does not exist in Vroozi Master Data. The message should display the associated accounting combination with the mentioned splits in the strings. Please review the error message that appears on the documents above the line item grid. The success and error messages should appear just above the  Save  and  Cancel  buttons. ( added on 2024-03-22 ) The system should keep the  Save  Item button disabled until the accounting validation error message persists. Please note that the R&D done so far does not show any instance in which a certain accounting object is required in the accounting configuration service and is optional on the line item modal.  So making this the basis for our assumption, we can say that the above scenario can happen technically but not practically. QA can run such scenarios in their testing activity.  In editing the line item, the system should only run the accounting validation if the user changes the fields required for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service. The system should show the green message when no errors are found. The system should show the error message if invalid accounting strings are identified. If the line item already has the invalid accounting string, then opening its line item modal should show the accounting validation error message on it. (Not required at this time)(Updated on  2024-03-22 ) If there is any custom accounting validation error message that exits, it should also be visible on the Line Item modal with the main message.

Once the user clicks the  View Error(s)  button, the system should revert the label to  Approve . The  Approve  button should remain disabled until all the accounting Validation errors are resolved. ( Existing implementation ) If the user updates the document without clicking the  View Error(s)  button, the system should change the label of the button from  View Error(s)  to  Approve .  The Sourcing approver can do the following actions based on the permission. Change in Header level fields. Change in Header level custom fields. Update existing line items. (from all avenues) Add new line items(from all avenues) Add notes/supplier notes Highlight the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box: Once the system scrolls the user to the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box above the Line Item grid after the  View Error(s)  button is clicked, the borders of the Accounting Validation Error(s) message box should be highlighted. The highlighted border should fade away gradually. Silkscreen on the Line Item grid (PR/CR on Load): When the system loads the PR/CR and accounting validation is in progress, the system should display the silkscreen covering the line item grid. On the silkscreen, there should be a text  Validating Data  visible. An  In Progress  Icon should be visible after the text  Validating Data. The silkscreen should prevent the user from clicking anything from the line item grid. The system should disable all the action button(s) on the PR/CR while the accounting validation process is in progress. The user should be able to edit all the header-level fields and custom fields that do not directly impact the line items. In case of any update, the system should save the changes in those header and custom fields. The system should disable the header level field  Shipping Address  while the accounting validation process is in progress. (Please let me know if any other header level field that impacts the line items directly) Once the accounting validation process is completed: The silkscreen from the line item grid should disappear. All the action buttons should be enabled. All the disabled header fields should be enabled. \u201cApproval Decision Code\u201d modal should be displayed. User should be able to select the decision code and click Submit button. On Clicking Submit button, user should be navigated to \u201cApprove Purchase Request\u201d grid. The system should show the accounting string error message above the line item grid for the line items having invalid accounting strings. ( existing implementation ) All the requirements mentioned above requirements should be implemented for the following users who can take action on the PR/CR: Sourcing Approver",

        "description": "Business Case: The system should run the accounting string validations at the Line Item modal. Acceptance Criteria: General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Creation: Currently, the system requires the definition of the required and optional Accounting/Organization objects in the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service . If the value in the optional field is given at the line item, the system considers it for the accounting validation in addition to the required fields. If the value in the optional field is not given at the line item, the system considers only the values in the required fields at the line item for the accounting validation. Based on that, the system decided what fields should be compared in the accounting validation with the accounting string master data. Accounting Validation at Line Item: The system should run the accounting validation as soon as it finds values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  on the line item modal. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system green message. The message should disappear in 3 seconds. If the system finds the accounting string errors, the system should show the following message This message should persist until the user resolves the issue. The system should run the accounting validation as soon as it finds values in all the required and optional fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  on the line item modal. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system green message. The message should disappear in 3 seconds. If the system finds the accounting string errors, the system should show the following message This message should persist until the user resolves the issue. The error message should be as follows when the line item is not split. Accounting String Error  The following Accounting String has been deactivated  \u2192 Error Code 02 The following Accounting String is not valid (does not exist)  \u2192 Error Code 01 Company Code = <Code> - <Description> Plant Code = <Code> - <Description> Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order = <Code> - <Description> GL Account = <Code> - <Description> \u2026 (display the rest of the elements in the same order the line items in separate lines) There should be a separate error message for each invalid accounting string associated with different splits of line items. The following is the pattern of the error message that should be followed: Accounting String Error - split #\u2026  \u2192 Display all splits of the item containing that Accounting String The following Accounting String has been deactivated  \u2192 Error Code 02 The following Accounting String is not valid (does not exist)  \u2192 Error Code 01 Company Code = <Code> - <Description> Plant Code = <Code> - <Description> Cost Center / WBS Element / Internal Order = <Code> - <Description> GL Account = <Code> - <Description> \u2026 (display the rest of the elements in the same order the line items in separate lines) The message should read \u201cAccounting String Error - split # (comma separated).\u201c. The message should read \u201cAccounting String Error - split # (- separated).\u201c in case of splits in the sequence has the same accounting string error. The message should tell the user why the selected accounting string combination of the mentioned line items was marked invalid. Either the string was deactivated. Or the string does not exist in Vroozi Master Data. The message should display the associated accounting combination with the mentioned splits in the strings. Please review the error message that appears on the documents above the line item grid. The success and error messages should appear just above the  Save  and  Cancel  buttons. ( added on ) The system should keep the  Save  Item button disabled until the accounting validation error message persists. Please note that the R&D done so far does not show any instance in which a certain accounting object is required in the accounting configuration service and is optional on the line item modal.  So making this the basis for our assumption, we can say that the above scenario can happen technically but not practically. QA can run such scenarios in their testing activity.  In editing the line item, the system should only run the accounting validation if the user changes the fields required for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service. The system should show the green message when no errors are found. The system should show the error message if invalid accounting strings are identified. If the line item already has the invalid accounting string, then opening its line item modal should show the accounting validation error message on it. (Not required at this time)(Updated on  ) If there is any custom accounting validation error message that exits, it should also be visible on the Line Item modal with the main message. (refer to  ) ( Added on   ) All AC points mentioned above should be implemented for the following documents where users can access the Line Item Modal. PR CR PO Create PO Wizard POCR All AC points mentioned above should be implemented for the following users who can take action on the documents listed above.

Acceptance Criteria: When client sends invoice via incoming endpoints, the system should queue the request and send the incoming invoice for asynchronous processing. Once the async process starts, the system should update the status of the request appropriately so client system can track the progress of the processing via status tracking endpoints (previously implemented) Once the process is complete, system should display the incoming invoice into the Invoice Inbox section in the UI ( For auto-creation of invoice OFF usecase ) If the process fails for any reason and the invoice metadata cannot be generated, the system should update the status of the request to indicate failure with proper error message.  If there is a failure related to network issues, system should be able to retry again for predefined number of times before failing the entire process. If the failure is due to data related issues where automatic retry is not applicable, the system should not do retry. Technical Details: We will use SQS for queuing request similar to cxml process Queue Name: int-vroozi-api-invoice-incoming-queue When request is received and validated, the transmission payload with only required details from incoming request payload should be send to the queue We will implement listener to process the incoming request in the background and convert and store it to incoming document metadata collection for further processing Source of this document in metadata collection should be called VROOZI_API",

File name should be generated uniquely (id), and might have unitId in the prefix, it could have vendor invoice Number as well if provided, and append timestamp to make this unique. Store the references of this file into the collection. 5-  docType can be used to determine the transactional document type, e.g InvoiceModel etc. 6- SQS Queue : Create a transactional document processing queue. Stores incoming document for asynchronous processing. Start with Invoice Processing Queue. (We can use one queue for all documents vs separate queue for each document).  Queue message {\n    \"transmissionId\": \"ac395c84-55f8-434a-80e2-abb2952e572b\",\n    \"type\": \"JSON\",  // XML, JSON, STRING, RAW_DATA, FILE, PLAIN_TEXT, CXML;\n    \"unitId\": \"2\"\n} 7- Return Async Response to Client : Once the incoming document is stored and file is uploaded to S3,  and transmission is send on SQS, we can return the response to client. Return the Async response {\n  \"trackingId\": \"98fea22e-1537-4b6c-b445-eda852132c6f\",\n  \"status\": \"PROCESSING\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-01-25T15:10:11.104+0000\"\n} 8- Expose the GET tracking by Id api, end point: v1/async-requests/{trakcingId} Response: {\n    \"id\": \"661d3819a5d9472e2266ecf0\",\n    \"trackingId\": \"ac395c84-55f8-434a-80e2-abb2952e572b\",\n    \"docType\": \"InvoiceModel\",\n    \"processingResult\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"payloadRef\": {\n                 \"id\":\"123213123212\", // S3 attachment Id\n                 \"label\" : \"Name of the file\",\n                 \"type\" : \"AttachmentModel\",\n                 \"archived\" : false\n              },\n            \"vendorInvoiceNumber\" : \"\",\n            \"externalId\" : \"\",\n            \"invoiceNumber\" : \"\", // what else we could have as unique identifier\n        }         \n        \"status\": PROCESSING,\n        \"errors\": [],\n        \"warnings\": []\n    },\n    \"status\": \"PROCESSING\", // IN_PROGRESS\n    \"dateCreated\": \"2024-04-15T14:22:17.270+0000\",\n    \"lastUpdated\": \"2024-04-15T14:22:17.270+0000\",\n    \"requestPath\": \"/api/invoices/incoming/async\",\n    \"requestMethod\": \"POST\"\n} 9- Preprocessing validation should return the response back to the client. If the payload is valid and accepted for processing, than we need to perform all post validations, e.g resource lookups, data integrity etc. 10- If we have any any error in the payload processing, we will give Internal Server error and will not store the transmission 11- When there is invalid Invoice payload (missing required fields or invalid enum values), we give the validation error. Required fields are: (invalid json), vendorInvoiceNumber",

In this epic, we will enable the system to pick the correct accounting/organization objects from the DB while uploading line items from the BOM file",

        "description": "Log injection occurs when an application fails to sanitize untrusted data used for logging. An attacker can forge log content to prevent an organization from being able to trace back malicious activities. What is the potential impact? If an attacker can insert arbitrary data into a log file, the integrity of the chain of events being recorded can be compromised. This frequently occurs because attackers can inject the log entry separator of the logger framework, commonly newlines, and thus insert artificial log entries. Other attacks could also occur requiring only field pollution, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection (for example, Log4Shell) if the logged data is fed to other application components, which may interpret the injected data differently. The focus of this rule is newline character replacement. Log Forge An attacker, able to create independent log entries by injecting log entry separators, inserts bogus data into a log file to conceal his malicious activities. This obscures the content for an incident response team to trace the origin of the breach as the indicators of compromise (IoCs) lead to fake application events. The following code is vulnerable to log injection as it constructs log entries using untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this to manipulate the chain of events being recorded. Noncompliant code example private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(\"Logger\");\n\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\n\n  String data = request.getParameter(\"data\");\n  if(data != null){\n    logger.log(Level.INFO, \"Data: {0} \", data);\n  }\n}\n Compliant solution private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(\"Logger\");\n\nprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\n\n  String data = request.getParameter(\"data\");\n  if(data != null){\n    data = data.replaceAll(\"[\\n\\r]\", \"_\");\n    logger.log(Level.INFO, \"Data: {0} \", data);\n  }\n} List of Issues",
