      "summary": "Payables: Enhanced PO Line Item Matching for AP Automation",
      "description": "This epic focuses on improving the efficiency and accuracy of the PO line item matching process within the AP workflow. By leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) for intelligent matching between parsed OCR data from PDF invoices and PO line items, the system will provide advanced tools for side-by-side comparison, user-driven corrections, and enhanced visibility into matching accuracy. Key features include enabling or disabling the PO matching feature at the supplier level, seamless integration of LLM matching logic, user-driven corrections, and dynamic visual indicators for matched, partially matched, and unmatched items. This epic also paves the way for future enhancements, such as leveraging flagged feedback to improve LLM accuracy over time, integrating AI learning loops, and introducing global configuration settings for matching logic. Planned User Stories for this Epic: Add a toggle in the supplier records to enable or disable the PO line item matching feature. Define the data integration process for sending parsed OCR and PO data to the LLM and receiving matching results. Implement a side-by-side comparison view for parsed OCR data and matched PO line items with editing and relinking capabilities. Provide an option to revert to the old system behavior for PO line-item handling. Allow users to flag matched line items as correct or incorrect for future reference and system improvement. Introduce visual indicators to identify perfect matches, partial matches, and unmatched items in invoices and side-by-side comparison views. Future Enhancements Under This Epic: AI-driven suggestions for unmatched or partially matched items based on historical data. Enhanced reporting and analytics for flagged items to track LLM performance. Allow bulk corrections for flagged incorrect matches. Introduce confidence scoring for LLM matching and user review prioritization. Develop customizable matching rules for specific suppliers or document types. This epic will streamline the PO matching process, reduce manual effort, and improve overall accuracy, significantly enhancing AP automation capabilities.",

As a system  Admin , I need a backend feature toggle to control whether the new PO line item matching features (including supplier-level toggles, LLM-based matching, side-by-side mapping, flagging, and visual indicators) are enabled or disabled for a specific client. Additionally, after the backend toggle has been activated, a new preference setting toggle should be visible, allowing Admin users to enable or disable the PO line item matching feature directly from the system. Which customers should this change impact?  Customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true What pages should this change impact?  The invoice page. Which users should be impacted by the change? Users who are allowed to create AP documents, namely, AP Processors, Managers, and Admins, and Users who are allowed to view / edit AP documents. How should this feature work? Feature Toggle Implementation: Introduce a  new  backend feature toggle labeled  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW__PO_LINE_ITEM_MATCHING . ( Open to shorter or different toggle name ) Default value for the toggle should be  OFF . Preference Setting Toggle: Once the backend feature toggle is turned ON, a new preference setting toggle labeled  \"Enable PO Line Item Matching\"  should appear under Vroozi Intelligence section. Tooltip text -  \u201cEnable advanced PO line-item matching using AI-powered data processing. This feature compares parsed invoice data with PO line items to improve matching accuracy and provides tools for side-by-side comparison, mapping, and match status visualization. \u201d. The preference toggle should allow Admin users to control whether the PO line-item matching features are applied to documents within the client\u2019s environment. Default value for the preference toggle should be OFF, even if the backend feature toggle is ON. Behavior When Toggle is OFF: The system retains its existing behavior without introducing any changes related to PO line item matching. Documents follow the standard flow, using PO line items directly if the PO number is captured. No changes to the supplier records or UI for side-by-side comparison or flagging features. Behavior When Toggle is ON: All features developed under the new PO line item matching process should be activated, including: Supplier-level toggle for enabling/disabling PO line item matching. Integration with LLM for data matching between PDF parsed items and PO line items. Side-by-side comparison and editable mapping for OCR data and PO line items. Revert-to-old-behavior option for specific documents. Line item flagging as correct/incorrect. Visual indicators for match statuses (perfect, partial, no match). Many more to come. Testing Requirements: Test all scenarios with the toggle  ON  to ensure new features are functioning correctly. Test with the toggle  OFF  to confirm the system reverts to the original behavior without any impact on existing functionality. Test scenarios where the feature toggle  does not exist  for a client: The system should behave as if the toggle is  OFF , retaining the existing behavior without any changes. Verify that no elements of the new PO line item matching features are visible or accessible to the client in this case. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes \u2013 both documents in process and historically processed documents. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams.

Admins can specify different confidence thresholds for each accounting object, such as company code or GL account, allowing for tailored auto-fill behavior based on prediction confidence. The system will use these thresholds to determine whether to populate fields automatically during invoice creation, enhancing the accuracy and control over automated data entry. Acceptance Criteria: Introduce Configurable Prediction Thresholds in Company Settings : A new configuration option should be available in smart coding related objects in the company settings, allowing admins to set custom confidence thresholds for each accounting object that the smart coding model can predict. Example: predictionAutoFillThreshold {     companyCode: 0.7,     glAccount: 0.9,     \u2026 } Auto-fill Accounting Predictions Based on Confidence Thresholds : When creating an invoice, the system should apply the configured thresholds to auto-fill predictions into the corresponding accounting fields.

Vertex tax connector is enabled 2. Requester spend limit is set to zero (0) 3. Financial Workflow should be enabled 4. Purchase Request (1000000622) has been created with 2 items which have different Suppliers and there some other details are as follows:  - 1st Item \u2192 QTY = 5, unitPrice = $35.60  - 2nd Item \u2192 QTY = 7, unitPrice = $38.25  - Shipping Address: Bajwa-Shipping Address\n3323 SE MILITARY DR\nSAN ANTONIO, TX 78223-3814 US Verify the vertex tax values of both items which we have (1st Item $14.68 and 2nd Item $22.09) Purchase Orders (2000009621, 2000009622) are split due to different suppliers on both of the Purchase Requests Step to Reproduce: 1. Login to PMAN as an Employee user 2. Load above Purchase Order (2000009621) 3. Do POCR by just updating the item delivery date and submit the changes 4. Load the Change Request (11000000183) and verify the changes   Actual Result: We have following observations in that case: 1. System calculated vertex tax value as $14.69 which we have $14.68 while creating Purchase Request 2. System didn\u2019t log that change in the POCR audit history Expected Result: System should behave consistent irrespective user is creating Purchase Request or Change Request",

We will be focusing on some RnD work to find out the best possible configurations to address the following tasks. If the kafka connector plugin is crashed we need to auto restart it (OPS) What is the size of the data written on kafka topics, identify if there is a limit and if yes is it enough to audit company settings. Identify how to change the limit if any. (DEV) Identify if the pre and post images are stored in the database as well apart from being written to kafka topics. If YES identify a way to delete these images from the database once they are used for auditing. Identify If connector is down, Does DB retains data, if yes for how much time Performance testing of pre and post audit of company setting update (QA) Identify what will happen in the case of error, does the connector break? Results: A new Rundeck job will be created which will be checking the status of the service and restart in case of failed status. The size is of 1mb which is enough for company settings since there is no document present in production db greater than 100kb. Fine tuning might be required in case we proceed with other collections.  These images are stored in a separate collection  config.system.preimages  and are automatically deleted along with entries from the op_log When the connector is restarted it picks up its lag and audit are the previous entries as well as long as they are available in op_log, if the connector is down for so long that op_log is cleared the entries are gone for good. Done Configurational changes are made to make sure it does not break.",

It is only meant to deal with the original tickets' requirements for making the cells in the first 2 columns of the table editable. See the section highlighted in  Red .  Business Case: As a standard feature, all users that log into a Parent unitID must be able to access a list of child unitIDs that they can navigate to, in order to conduct business. This should be available to Non-admin users in the Parent unitID by default, and to Admin users as an option (once we introduce the reporting dashboard for them).

        "description": "Business Case: When a user belonging to a \u201cParent\u201d unitID; as defined in   , logs into the system with their username & password, Vroozi needs a way to identify this user and upon authenticating them, must route them into the parent unitID, instead of a child unitID. Alternatively, if the user logging into the system is identified as NOT belonging to a parent unitID, they should be directed to the single child unitID that they belong to, as usual.  Why do this? Why don\u2019t we just log the parent unitID\u2019s user directly into the parent unitID, like we do for child unitID users? The reason we are adding this logic to the authentication process is because, in the future, we will want to allow Admins in the parent unitID to selectively \u201cupgrade\u201d a child unitID\u2019s user to a parent unitID user. Whereby, when that upgraded user logs into Vroozi in the future, we will want to route them to the parent unitID, instead of the child unitID their user account was originally created in.  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The feature flag added in    should be enabled for this parent unitID.  There should be at least 1 child unitID linked to this parent unitID.  One or more users should exist in this parent unitID and be active.  One or more users should exist in the linked child unitID(s) and be active.  There should be a way to identify users with access to a parent unitID. This identifier could, in the futre, be used for reporting as well.  When the user enters their username/passwrod combination on the Vroozi login screen, and submits it to the BE service for processing, the system should fetch the user\u2019s record from the DB based on the provided credentials.  From this user record, the system needs to determine if this user has access to the parent unitID, or to a child unitID. If the system determines that the user belongs to a parent unitID, then the user should be routed to the relevant parent unitID.

        "description": "Business Case: We need to enable specific users in Maersk to oversee, and to some degree, manage the multiple Vroozi unitIDs that they will be using in PROD. We do NOT want to change how indivudal unitIDs are provisioned, or run on a given server. However, we want to enable the creation of a \u201cParent\u201d entity over an arbitrary number of individual unitIDs. This \u201cParent\u201d will be used to view aggregrate reporting data against all the child unitIDs, and also wo provision user accounts for users that need to access multiple child unitIDs.  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The feature toggle introduced in    should be enabled for the unitID.  Vroozi should be able to specify an arbitrary number of active unitIDs on a given server, as \u201cChild\u201d unitIDs of the current \u201cParent\u201d unitID.  A single unitID cannot be the \u201cChild\u201d of multiple \u201cParent\u201d unitIDs.  A unitID that is already flagged as a \u201cParent\u201d unitID cannot be the \u201cChild\u201d unitID of another parent.  A unitID that is already a \u201cChild\u201d unitID and is linked to an eisting \u201cParent\u201d, cannot be designated as a Parent unitID.  It should be possible for Vroozi to establish this link between parent/child unitIDs at both unitID creation time, as well as after the fact.  We will need to create data-fix scripts for use by Ops, which will:  Convert an existing unitID into a Child unitID of an existing Parent unitID Convert multiple existing unitIDs into Child unitIDs of an existing Parent unitID",
