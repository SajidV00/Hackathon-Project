However, when the user applies sorting on another field from the UI (default is  paymentDueDate ), sorting is applied to both fields, making the query inefficient. We excluded all date filters from this condition, but we should also exclude any filter which has a unique field. Query: {\"deleted\":false,\"unitId\":\"160\",\"accessibleByAP\":true,\"userId\":{\"$in\":[\"78726\"]}},\"sort\":{\"invoiceNumber\":1,\"createdDate\":1} Code: com.vroozi.api.common.filter.PageFilter#buildPageable   static Pageable buildPageable(\n      Integer pageSize, Integer currentPage, String sortField, Sort.Direction sortOrder\n  ) {\n    Sort.Direction direction = isNull(sortOrder) ?

This should subsequently delete the corresponding user records created in any of the linked child unitIDs that the affected user may have had access to. The user deletion option should not permanently remove the user records from the database layer, as doing so will have negative repercussions throughout the system. instead, these records should be flagged, so they longer show up in an interactive manner, within the applciation. Acceptance Criteira: Prerequisites: The user carrying out these operations should be logged into the Parent unitID The user carrying out these operations should have the Master Admin role assigned to them within the context of the Parent unitID The user being affected by these operations should have been created in the Parent unitID, with a non-Admin role Deleting a user record in the Parent unitID: The Master should be able to click on the \u201cdelete\u201d icon for an individual user record, in the user management table.  Clicking on this icon should display a secondary pop-up message for the Master Admin, as king them to confirm that they want to proceed with the intended action.  The modal should have the title \u201c Are you sure? \u201c The modal should display the message \u201c Deleting a user will remove their ability to access any of the business units they may have had access to. This is a non-reversible action. Are you sure you want to proceed with this? \u201c The modal should present the user with 2 buttons;  Cancel  and  Yes . Clicking on cancel should dismiss the modal, and the system\u2019s state should not change as a result. The affected user\u2019s records will remain as they were.  Clicking on Yes, will proceed with the user record deletion.  Effect of user record deletion on the system\u2019s state: Once a user\u2019s record has been deleted by a Master Admin; via the Parent unitID, the system should \u2026  Mark the affected user\u2019s record as \u201cdeleted\u201d in the Parent unitID, so that the user is no longer able to access the Parent unitID. Their user is not visible in the user management table. Nor is their user surfaced as an active, selectable option anywhere in the unitID.

Their user is not visible in the user management table. Nor is their user surfaced as an active, selectable option anywhere in the unitID. The system should retain all user records at the database layer, so any programmatic / data references to that record remain intact, and none of the system\u2019s functionality breaks as a result of this \u201cdeletion\u201d. Effect on a user\u2019s active session(s), if their record is deleted by a Master Admin: If a user is logged into an active session, when the Master Admin deletes their user record from the Parent unitID, that user needs to be automatically logged out of all active sessions.",

        "description": "When a user is reactivated by the Master Admin, ONLY access to the child unitID\u2019s specified in their user record should be reinstated.  What if a child unitID Admin tries to create a user record, for a user that was already provisioned via the linked Parent unitID? Answer: The system should show an appropriate error message. (This should be handled in a separate ticket, at a later date.) Business Case:   Master Admins need the ability to manage user access efficiently across linked child unitIDs from within the Parent unitID. This includes the capability to revoke a user\u2019s access to a specific child unitID when necessary. Currently, while users can be assigned access to multiple child unitIDs, there is no streamlined process for revoking access at the Parent unitID level. Implementing this feature ensures better control over user permissions, reduces security risks, and aligns with governance policies. Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The user must have been originally provisioned via the Parent unitID. The user performing these actions should be a Master Admin, and present in the Parent unitID. Access Revocation Execution: Master Admins should be able to navigate to the user management screen in the Parent unitID. Master Admins should be able to revoke access to a child unitID, by clicking on the \"x\" within the \"pill\" representing that specific unitID, within the \"<add field label here>\" field. Confirmation Message: When a Master Admin clicks on the \"x\" for a child unitID, a confirmation message should appear. The message should inform the Admin of the consequences of revoking access, including: The user will lose access to the selected child unitID. The action is reversible only from the Parent unitID. The user record in the Parent unitID will retain necessary data for potential reinstatement. Message to be displayed in the confirmation modal:  'You are about to revoke this user's access to [Child UnitID]. This action will immediately remove their ability to operate within this account. If needed, access can be restored later. Are you sure you want to proceed?' The message should include options to  Confirm  or  Cancel  the action. Effects of Revocation: Once confirmed, the following actions should occur: The user should no longer have access to the revoked child unitID. The child unitID should no longer appear in the user\u2019s record within the Parent unitID as an accessible option. The user\u2019s profile should be removed from the child unitID\u2019s user management list. All permissions and configurations for that child unitID should be archived for potential restoration. The user\u2019s Change history should be updated with the details of this event.  The event should record this change the same way that removing values from other multi-select fields (e.g. the Company Code field in the Access section) works. The main change should be displayed in the audit log as \u201c The value in <field display name> was modified. \u201c Underneath this, the system should display exactly what change was made, \u201c - Removed: Business Unit - <Company Name of the Child unitID that was removed> \u201c Data Retention for Future Restoration: The system should retain the user\u2019s prior configurations for the revoked child unitID. If access is later reinstated, the system should restore the user\u2019s previous configurations by default, if still valid. If any previous configurations are no longer valid, affected fields should be left empty for manual reassignment. Restoration Process & Configuration Validation: If a Master Admin chooses to restore access to the revoked child unitID: The child unitID should be re-added to the user\u2019s accessible unitIDs list. The system should verify the validity of previously assigned configurations. If any settings are outdated or unavailable \u2026  For single select fields, the system should remove the old value and leave them empty For multi-select fields, the system should highlight the affected \u201cpill\u201d with an orange border, show a \u201c?\u201d icon in the pill, where hovering over it will show a message to the Master Admin letting them know what the problem is.  Error Handling: If access revocation fails due to system issues, an error message should notify the Admin and prompt a retry. The message should read: 'An error occurred while revoking access to [Child UnitID]. Please try again. If the issue persists, contact support.' This message should be clearly displayed and provide guidance on the next steps. Testing Considerations: Verify that only Master Admins can revoke access. Ensure that access revocation immediately removes the user from the child unitID\u2019s user list. Validate that reinstating access restores previous configurations unless outdated. Confirm that actions are logged appropriately for audit purposes.",

        "description": "Business Case:   Master Admins in a Parent unitID have the ability to manage access for other users to child unitIDs linked to the Parent unitID they are currently logged into. However, a Master Admin should only be able to assign access to child unitIDs that they themselves have access to. Additionally, if a user\u2019s record contains child unitIDs that the Master Admin does not have access to, those unitIDs should remain hidden from the Master Admin. This ensures that sensitive access information remains restricted, maintaining the principle of least privilege and preventing unnecessary exposure of data. Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The Master Admin must be logged into the Parent unitID. The user record being accessed should contain child unitIDs that may or may not overlap with the Master Admin\u2019s accessible unitIDs. User Record Access & Visibility Constraints: Master Admins should be able to access another user's record via the user management screen in the Parent unitID. When opening a user\u2019s record, the system should display the child unitIDs that the user currently has access to. The only exception to the above rule is that the system should filter out any child unitIDs that the Master Admin does not have access to. The Master Admin should neither see these restricted child unitIDs as selected, nor as selectable options in the user record. Handling of Hidden Child unitIDs: If a user has access to child unitIDs that the Master Admin does not, the system should present the user record as if the user has no access to those unitIDs. There should be no indication that additional child unitIDs exist outside the Master Admin\u2019s scope. Assignment Restrictions: When modifying a user\u2019s child unitID access, the Master Admin should only be able to assign unitIDs that they themselves have access to. Testing Considerations: Verify that a Master Admin can only see and assign child unitIDs that they have access to. Validate that when a Master Admin opens a user record, restricted child unitIDs remain hidden. Test various permission scenarios, including: A Master Admin with full access to all child unitIDs. A Master Admin with limited access to specific child unitIDs. A Master Admin attempting to modify a user\u2019s access beyond their scope.",

Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The currently logged in user must be a Master Admin.  The user should be present in the Parent unitID.  The user must have already opened an existing user record, and the system should have already loaded all child unitID configs for that user record.  What can the Master Admin do on the user modal, when editing the user record? Screen 1 Screen 2 Screen 3 When a Master Admin clicks on the \u201cCreate a new user\u201d button, the system should display the standard user creation modal to them.  This modal will be different in the following ways from the standard user creation modal shown in child / standalone unitIDs:  In the \u201cBasic Information\u201c section of the modal, there should be a new single-select drop-down field.  This field should be titled \u201cPrimary user Role\u201c.  This drop-down should list 2 options; \u201cMaster Administrator\u201c & \u201cNon-Administrator\u201c.  This field should be empty by default on the modal.  This field should be a required field.  if the user does not select a value in this field, the field should be highlighted with a red border, and the \u201cSave User\u201d button on the modal should remain disabled.  Under the \u201cBasic Information\u201d section, there should be a new section added to the modal, titled \u201cBusiness Unit Configuration\u201c.  This new section should have the following controls:  A first multi-select type-ahead field titled \u201cAllow access to these business units\u201c. The user should see options for the child unitIDs connected to the currently logged in Parent unitID. The options list should present these options using their respective Company Name values.  The user should be able to search for an option by it\u2019s name, by typing the search terms into the field.  The user should be able to select more than one of these options.  Any option already selected by the user, should no longer be presented as a selectable option in the list.  The selected values should be displayed in the field, in individual \u201cpills\u201d. With a \u201cx\u201d in each pill, to allow the user to remove/deselect one of these choices.  The second single-select type-ahead field titled \u201cUser settings for\u201c, should only become visible once the Master Admin has selected at least 1 option in the 1st field.  This drop-down should only present; as options, the choices that the the Master Admin has already selected in the 1st field.  The options should be presented using the child unitID\u2019s company name value.  The user should ONLY be able to select 1 of the listed options at a time.  There should be an informational message in this section, below the fields mentioned above.  The message should be preceded by a yellow \u201c?\u201d (already used elsewhere in the application)  Under this image, there should be the message \u201cPlease allow the user to access one or more business units, in order to configure the user's settings for that account.\u201c This message should be visible whilst the user hasn\u2019t selected any value in the 1st field.  Once the user select\u2019s a value in the 1st field, but has yet to select one in the 2nd field, this message should be replaced by a new message, stating \u201cPlease select a business unit, for which you would like to configure this user's account settings.\u201c The updated message, as well as the \u201c?\u201d image should disappear once the user select's a value in the 2nd field.  The other standard sections of the user modal should be hidden by default.  These sections should ONLY become visible once the Master Admin selects a value for the 2nd field mentioned above.  Every time the Master Admin changes the selection within the 2nd field, the other sections below the \u201cBusiness Unit Configuration\u201c section, should be reloaded to reflect the data/settings for the respective child unitID.  All data / configurations from these sections should ONLY be applicable to the user\u2019s record in the child unitID that is currently selected on the modal.  The \u201cSave User\u201d button should remain disabled, until the Master Admin has filled out all required fields on the modal.",

        "description": "Business Case: Master Admins managing users across multiple child unitIDs need the ability to activate or deactivate user records directly from the Parent unitID. This feature will ensure consistent user access control across the system, reducing manual work and the risk of mismanagement. When a user\u2019s record is activated or deactivated (which can be done from the user management grid, or by dismissing an assigned child unitID from the user modal) in the Parent unitID, the system should propagate the change to the relevant child unitIDs, ensuring appropriate access and configurations are maintained or revoked automatically. Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The currently logged-in user must be a Master Admin. The user record being updated must belong to the Parent unitID and has access to at least 1 child unitID. Deactivating a User Record When a Master Admin deactivates a user\u2019s record in the Parent unitID: The system should deactivate the affected user\u2019s record in the Parent unitID. The system should automatically propagate the deactivation to the child unitIDs that the user had access to: Deactivate the user\u2019s record in each of these child unitIDs. A success confirmation message should display, summarizing the changes: \" The selected user records have been deactivated. \" In the case of this operation failing, the system should display the following message to the user: \" Oops!

Display a success message: \" The selected user records have been reactivated with their previous configurations restored. \" In the case of this operation failing, the system should display the following message to the user: \" Oops! Something went wrong, and the selected user records could not be reactivated. \" General Requirements: The \" Activate/Deactivate \" actions should be available in the main user management screen as buttons or actions in a dropdown menu. Bulk activation/deactivation should be supported: If multiple records are selected, the system should display a consolidated success/failure message summarizing the results. Any errors encountered during propagation to child unitIDs should be logged, and a partial success message should be displayed, e.g., \" The selected user records were < deactivated / activated> in the Parent Company Account, but some child Company Accounts failed to update. Please contact Vroozi Support with details of the user record your were tryig to update. \" Audit Logging: Log every activation/deactivation action performed by the Master Admin, in the affected user\u2019s record.

If not, record this failure as a detail in the event.  Question Answer Asked by Asked on Answered by Answered on What should happen, if a Master Admin is editing an Inactive user record, and provides that user access to a child unitID? Should the user record in the child unitID be created in active, or inactive state?  We should prevent the Master Admin from assigning access to additional child unitIDs, on an inactive user record. The Master Admin should be asked to first reactivate the user record.            to split the 2nd option in the reactivation flow, into it\u2019s own ticket. A modal dialogue; with the title \u201c Activate User Record \u201c,  should prompt the Master Admin to choose how to proceed: The modal should display the message \u201c When activating a user, you can choose one of the following options: \u201c Option 1: Reactivate the user record and restore access to the same child unitIDs as previously configured. Option 2: Reactivate the user record without restoring access to child unitIDs, requiring manual reassignment and reconfiguration. There should be 2 action buttons presented to the user on this modal: \u201c Activate and Restore Access \u201c \u201c Only Activate \u201c For Option 1 ( Reactivate and Restore Access ): For Option 2 ( Only Reactivate ): The system should reactivate the affected user\u2019s record in the Parent unitID. Remove the user\u2019s access to all previously configured child unitIDs, and soft-delete the affected user\u2019s record(s) in the child unitIDs that they\u2019re losing access to.  Automatically open the user record modal for reconfiguration (if activating a single user): The modal should display a message: \" Please configure the user\u2019s access to child unitIDs. \" If multiple user records are activated in one go, skip opening the user record modal. Display a success message: \" The selected <user record has / user records have> been reactivated in the Parent Company Account. Child Company Account access has been removed. \"",

It is only meant to deal with the original tickets' requirements for making the cells in the first 2 columns of the table editable. See the section highlighted in  Red .  Business Case: As a standard feature, all users that log into a Parent unitID must be able to access a list of child unitIDs that they can navigate to, in order to conduct business. This should be available to Non-admin users in the Parent unitID by default, and to Admin users as an option (once we introduce the reporting dashboard for them).  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The unitID must be configured to work as a Parent unitID There must be at least 2 Child unitIDs connected to it.  The user logging in has access to child unitIDs and must be a Parent unitID user How should the user be able to get to this list of Child unitIDs? When the user logs into the Parent unitID, this is the screen they should land on.  If the user is on another screen in the Parent unitID, they should be able to navigate to this screen by clicking on the \u201cBusiness Units\u201d link in the left nav bar.  What should the user see on this screen when they land on it? The user should see a message at the top of the screen.  This message should read \u201c TBD \u201c. The user should be able to dismiss this message by clicking on a \u201cClose\u201d button in the section containing the message.  However, this message should reappear when the user logs into the application again. While still logged in, if the user dismisses the message, there is no need to display it again, for the duration of that logged in session.  When the user navigatess back to the Parent unitID, from a child unitID, the system can once again display the message, unless the user had previously clocked on the \u201cDon\u2019t show again\u201c checkbox.  The user should be able to dismiss the message for good, by checking the \u201cDon\u2019t show again\u201c checkbox next to the \u201cClose\u201d button.  The user should see the page title as \u201cBusiness Units\u201c The user should see a table below that, with the following columns:  Business Unit Description Last Accessed on Action The Business Unit column should list all the Child unitIDs linked to the current Parent unitID, that the logged in user has access to. By default, this list should display the values found in these Child unitID\u2019s Company  \u2192 Profile \u2192 Company Name field.  The Description column should only display a value if the Parent unitID Admin provides a description for this Child unitID. Otherwise, the column can show an \u201cn/a\u201d for rows that do not have a description.  The Last Accessed on column should display the most recent date that the user navigated to that specific child unitID. This value should be updated by the system, every time the user navigates to that specific Child unitID.  The Action column should include icons for the following controls:  Edit The Edit icon should ONLY be available to the user if they have the Parent unitID Admin role assigned.  The Edit icon should be a pencil glyph Clicking on this should make the first 2 cells for that specific row editable. and change the pencil icon to a \u201csave\u201d icon (perhaps a \u201ctick mark\u201d).  The cell in the Business Unit column is mandatory. The user should not be able to save the row without providing some value in this cell. This cell CANNOT use the same value as another Child unitID that\u2019s connected to the current Parent unitID. If the user enters such a value, the system should highlight the text input field with a red border, and display a red \u201c!\u201d icon in the input field; aligned to the right edge of the field. Hovering over this icon should display a tool-tip with the message \u201cTBD\u201c.  The cell in the Description column is optional. The user can save the row without providing a value in this field if they don\u2019t want to.  Navigate to The Navigate to icon should be visible to all users that log into the Parent unitID and have access to that specific Child unitID.  The Navigate to icon should be a square with an arrow pointing up and to the right, out of it.  Clicking on this should navigate the user to that specific child unitID, in the same browser tab.  How many unitIDs will be listed in this table? There is no restriction at the moment, on how many child unitIDs can be linked to a parent unitID, or how many of those a single user can be given access to.

Clicking on either will navigate the user to that specific child unitID, in the same browser window/tab.  How will the user know when they are in a child unitID? When the user is in a child unitID, the application will include a persistent header at the top of the standard Vroozi UI.  This header will include the message \u201cYou are currently logged into <Business Unit>\u201c.  Where the value of <Business Unit> will be dynamically determined based on the specific child unitID\u2019s Company Name value.  This header will remain in place as long as the user is present in the child unitID, to ensure that they are always aware of the context in which they are operating.  How will the user navigate back to the Parent unitID? At any point, if the user feels like navigating back to the parent unitID that they originally logged into, they can click the \u201cGo back to <Business Unit>\u201c button.

How can a user navigate to another child unitID, from the one they\u2019re currently logged into? At any point; whilst logged into a child unitID, if the user feels like navigating to a different child unitID, they can do so by using the unitID selection control in the persistent header.  There will be a single-select drop-down field in the header, labeled \u201cSwitch Business Unit:\u201c.  This drop-down will present as a list of options, the child unitIDs that the user has access to, based on their user record. (See   for details) This drop-down must display; as the selected option, the child unitID that the user is currently present in.  The user can click into this drop-down and change the selection to another child unitID that they have access to.

Once the user select\u2019s a value in the 1st field, but has yet to select one in the 2nd field, this message should be replaced by a new message, stating \u201cPlease select a business unit, for which you would like to configure this user's account settings.\u201c The updated message, as well as the \u201c?\u201d image should disappear once the user select's a value in the 2nd field.  The other standard sections of the user modal should be hidden by default.  These sections should ONLY become visible once the Master Admin selects a value for the 2nd field mentioned above.  Every time the Master Admin changes the selection within the 2nd field, the other sections below the \u201cBusiness Unit Configuration\u201c section, should be reloaded to reflect the data/settings for the respective child unitID.  All data / configurations from these sections should ONLY be applicable to the user\u2019s record in the child unitID that is currently selected on the modal.  The \u201cSave User\u201d button should remain disabled, until the Master Admin has filled out all required fields on the modal.  Should the user history functionality be split out into a separate ticket? Or will that just work out of the box?  Need a new ticket for the user audit trail.  How should the user be informed that their account has been provisioned in the Parent unitID? The user whose account has just been created, should receive the standard account creation confirmation email.  This email should allow them to create a password for the Parent unitID.",

The Description column should only display a value if the Parent unitID Admin provides a description for this Child unitID. Otherwise, the column can show an \u201cn/a\u201d for rows that do not have a description.  The Last Accessed on column should display the most recent date that the user navigated to that specific child unitID. This value should be updated by the system, every time the user navigates to that specific Child unitID.  The Action column should include icons for the following controls:  Edit The Edit icon should ONLY be available to the user if they have the Parent unitID Admin role assigned.  The Edit icon should be a pencil glyph Clicking on this should make the first 2 cells for that specific row editable. and change the pencil icon to a \u201csave\u201d icon (perhaps a \u201ctick mark\u201d).  The cell in the Business Unit column is mandatory. The user should not be able to save the row without providing some value in this cell. This cell CANNOT use the same value as another Child unitID that\u2019s connected to the current Parent unitID.

Alternatively, if the user logging into the system is identified as NOT belonging to a parent unitID, they should be directed to the single child unitID that they belong to, as usual.  Why do this? Why don\u2019t we just log the parent unitID\u2019s user directly into the parent unitID, like we do for child unitID users? The reason we are adding this logic to the authentication process is because, in the future, we will want to allow Admins in the parent unitID to selectively \u201cupgrade\u201d a child unitID\u2019s user to a parent unitID user. Whereby, when that upgraded user logs into Vroozi in the future, we will want to route them to the parent unitID, instead of the child unitID their user account was originally created in.  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: The feature flag added in    should be enabled for this parent unitID.  There should be at least 1 child unitID linked to this parent unitID.  One or more users should exist in this parent unitID and be active.  One or more users should exist in the linked child unitID(s) and be active.  There should be a way to identify users with access to a parent unitID. This identifier could, in the futre, be used for reporting as well.  When the user enters their username/passwrod combination on the Vroozi login screen, and submits it to the BE service for processing, the system should fetch the user\u2019s record from the DB based on the provided credentials.  From this user record, the system needs to determine if this user has access to the parent unitID, or to a child unitID. If the system determines that the user belongs to a parent unitID, then the user should be routed to the relevant parent unitID.  If the system determines that the user does not belong to a parent unitID, then the user should be routed to the appropriate child unitID that they belong to.   to create a separate ticket for this requirement below:   A user CANNOT exist in multiple child unitIDs without also belonging to a parent unitID.",

As a  user submitting a dispute , I want the  Reason(s)  field to be clearer, better aligned, and easier to read when multiple reasons are selected, So that I can accurately understand and review the dispute reasons without confusion. Which customers should this change impact? Customers who have  ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW  = true, and  Dispute Invoice via Supplier Portal  toggle = ON. What pages should this change impact?  Invoices in these statuses - Draft. Parked. Rejected. Which users should be impacted by the change? Document creator/owner (AP Processor). Any AP Manager How should this feature work? Field Title Update: Update the field title from  \" Reason* \"  to  \"Reason(s)*\"  to reflect that multiple dispute reasons can be selected. Field Alignment & Length: Increase the length of the  Reason(s)  field so that it aligns with other fields in the  Dispute Destination Dialog Box  for a consistent UI. Improved Multi-Selection Display: Modify the way multiple dispute reasons are displayed in the  Reason(s)  field. Instead of truncating selections (which currently limits visibility to 1 or 2 reasons), display multiple reasons in a  stacked format (one below the other)  similar to how the  Company Code Restrictions  field is displayed in the system today. Ensure users can clearly see all selected dispute reasons without needing to expand the field. If the text exceeds the field size, the user can hover over the reason to view the full text. Spacing Improvement: Reduce the space between the  Dispute sub-text  and the  warning message  within the dialog box to improve readability and maintain a cleaner layout. Re-positioning of the Dispute Via field: Move the  Dispute Via field  above the User field in the  Dispute Destination Dialog Box . Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Maybe.
