Note: When we edit a catalog, the child version of that catalog is added to the Working column. In this case, the system generates a new record in the catalog collection of database with a reference to the parent catalog. During this process, the system also creates data in the  catalog_item  collection against the child catalog reference. When the child version of the catalog is approved and then published, the system marks that child catalog version as soft deleted but hard deletes the child catalog associated catalog items. If the user doesn\u2019t edit any catalog item that has associated Custom Fields, the system keeps references of these child associated items in those Custom Fields. It keeps adding and not removing invalid references.",

Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date Vroozi Admin should see everything un-restricted because he would not have any user groups assigned. Need to update the description so that testing can be done for this scenario. If we do not assign a User group to a Vroozi Admin, will it break the system today? Based on that answer we need to decide this field should be available for this user and also mandatory or not. \u00a0   \u00a012/31/2024 \u00a0   \u00a01/2/2025 Need to check how SOLR data-fix would be required for old suppliers that would require data-script to add a User Group. We cannot do a data-fix. Bulk upload or manual update required on the supplier side for User Groups in order for the results to show up in SOLR.   12/31/2024   1/2/2025 Should we filter the list of available Locations based on the user\u2019s group definitions? Currently, the user only sees Locations associated with at least one Supplier they can search for, so it would be ideal to retain the existing functionality. Yes, we should filter the locations based on the user group that the user is associated to and which suppliers are linked to this location. No reason why other locations for suppliers that belong to a different user group shows up in the dropdown.   12/31/2024 1/2/2025 Do we need to filter the Categories, Attributes, Custom Fields based on the User Groups as well in the Advanced Search section?  Can you please check in with   on this in the office so that we can get some clarity on how this is implemented on the BE and accordingly decide how to tackle Advanced search.

Behavior on SDM Side : Always Mandatory : On the SDM side, users are expected to have SDM roles by default. The  User_Group  field is always mandatory in the bulk upload template. Admins must provide an active, non-deleted User Group name in the  User_Group  column. Error Handling in Bulk Upload : If the  User_Group  field is empty or contains an invalid value (non-existent, deleted, or inactive User Group), the system should: Use the existing error messaging style in the generated error report. Bulk Download : When Admins download the user bulk file: The  User_Group  field should display the name of the User Group linked to each SDM user\u2019s record. For Non-SDM users, the  User_Group  field should remain blank. Validation Rules : The system must validate the  User_Group  field during the bulk upload process to ensure: The User Group exists. The User Group is active and not deleted. The field is populated for SDM users when required. UI and Experience : Ensure consistency between PMAN and SDM templates for field naming and behavior. Display clear error messages in the error report for missing or invalid  User_Group  data. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  Purchase Team.

Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  The \"User Groups\" construct will serve as the foundational building block for future enhancements that link user records and supplier records. This functionality will allow Admins to configure and control the system access and functionalities available to different SDM users. Which customers should this change impact?  Customers using the SDM module (ex: NBCU). What pages should this change impact?  SDM > Master Data > Users page. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Vroozi Admin and SDM Admin. How should this feature work? User Groups Grid : The grid displays the following columns: Checkbox  (select for activation/deactivation). Group Name . Description . Created On  (date the group was created). Status  (Active/Inactive). Action  (delete option). The grid showcases up to 10 User Groups per pagination page, with additional groups displayed in subsequent pages. Create a New User Group : Admin should see a  \"Create a New User Group\"  button on the  User Groups  page. Clicking the button opens a dialog modal containing: Group Name : Text field (mandatory). Description : Text field (mandatory). Cancel  and  Save User Group  buttons. The  Save User Group  button should be  disabled by default . The button should only be  enabled  when both mandatory fields ( Group Name  and  Description ) are filled out. Clicking  Save User Group  creates a new User Group and displays a  green NOTY message : User Group added. View and Update Existing User Groups : Admin can click on an existing User Group's name in the grid. Clicking the name opens the  same dialog modal  populated with the group's current  Group Name  and  Description . The  Save User Group  button should only be enabled if both mandatory fields are filled out. Admin can edit one or both fields and click the  Save User Group  button to update the User Group. If no changes are made, clicking  Save User Group  should leave the User Group unchanged. Clicking  Save User Group  after changes displays a  green NOTY message : User Group updated. Validation Check : Group Name  needs to be  Unique . If not unique, at the time of saving the User Group, the system should throw an error message - Group Name should be unique. Search Functionality : Admins can search for User Groups using a search bar similar to the user search bar. Activate/Deactivate User Groups : Admins can select one or more User Groups using checkboxes and use  Activate  or  Deactivate  buttons to update their status. Delete User Groups : Admins can delete a User Group using the  Delete Action  in the grid. Pagination : The grid supports pagination, showing a maximum of 10 User Groups per page.

Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date I think User Groups is quite generic and can be interpreted in many different ways and hence do you think we should rename it?

Upon successful connection, the system should save these credentials in the DB. In addition, the system should save the unitID information in the DB. In case of invalid credentials, the system should show the error message from the Costpoint in the overlay. ( This image is for reference. Actual message from the Costpoint may vary ) All the information stored in the DB should be encrypted. Technical Requirements: We need to create a connector page for CostPoint application to allow client to provide Costpoint specific connection details for authentication and authorization via our admin UI. The connection details provided should be stored securely for our middleware to consume and connect to Costpoint API for subsequent integration.

Update Purchase Request by ID. Update Purchase Request by request number. The system should validate the budget if the specified budget is present in the list of budgets fetched based on the update logic mentioned above. The system should throw the validation error if the specified budget is not in the list of budgets fetched based on the update logic mentioned above.
