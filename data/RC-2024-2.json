        "description": "Since the mongo driver has updated its core implementation , we need to identify the potential areas where findOne should be replaced with findFirst using the production data and spring data mongo repositories. GL Accounts and Cost Centers with same code and company Code are created with different names. Though this seems invalid data as from API documents these accounting elements can be searched by Code while creating e.g. purchase request and in this case the system used to pick anyone of the records based on the first found record. We need to put a validation so that this kind of data is not created. For now since the new driver gives error we can replace findOne with findFirst to mimic the system\u2019s old behaviour. Multiple supplier task with  completed : false  data can be created in an edge case. In such a scenario the previous task should be marked completed before creating another. For now we can replace findOne with findFirst to mimic the system\u2019s old behaviour. The issue can be produced against the following steps create PO (with price 200) Confirm PO from Supplier Portal Create POCR (price increase to 500) Dispute from Supplier Portal POCR again (set price to 300) Create ASN",

        "description": "Business Case : Currently, our system encounters a challenge when an Invoice returns from Exception Handling with an accounting string error after the Goods Receipt has been created. The system lacks a defined process for handling such accounting validation exceptions during this stage. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  If an accounting validation error is detected during the return of an Invoice from Exception Handling after the Goods Receipt has been created, the system should recognize this scenario and accordingly automate the Exception Handling process further. Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTING_STRING_VALIDATION = true. What pages should this change impact?  Invoices in Exception status. Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Processor / AP Manager / Exception Handling group users. How should this change work? Detection of Accounting String Error : If an accounting validation error is detected during the return of an Invoice from Exception Handling after the Goods Receipt has been created, the system should recognize this scenario. Auto-Processing Rule Evaluation : The system should check the Auto-Processing rule configured for cXML and Supplier Portal invoices. Decision Making for Supplier Portal & cXML created Invoices : Based on the Auto-Processing rule, the system should determine whether the Invoice requires further attention by an Exception Handling group or can proceed to the next stage. Invoice created from Auto create invoices from Supplier Portal / cXML toggle GR Exception toggle Accounting String Error toggle Accounting String Error found? Decision Supplier Portal / cXML ON ON ON Yes GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  ANY  Accounting String Error,  Send Invoice to the User Group/Type selected for Accounting String Error for resolving the exception. The Assigned Exception Handler is allowed to resolve Accounting String Errors. The Assigned Exception Handler is able to return the Invoice back to AP. Supplier Portal / cXML ON ON ON No GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  NO  Accounting String Error, Follow current implementation. Supplier Portal / cXML ON ON OFF Yes GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  ANY  Accounting String Error,  Return Invoice back to AP and assign the Invoice Owner or AP Processor / Manager group depending on the Access rules. ( how it works currently in the system ) The AP user should see the Accounting string error. The AP user is allowed to send the Invoice for Exception handling in order to resolve the Accounting String Errors. Supplier Portal / cXML ON ON OFF No GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  NO  Accounting String Error, Follow current implementation. Decision Making for Invoices created manually by AP User : Invoice created from GR Exception Accounting String Error found? Decision Hopper or Manually by AP user. Yes Yes GR is created and it resolves the Missing GR exception on the Invoice.  When moving to the next state, during Auto-processing, if the system finds  ANY  Accounting String Error, Return Invoice back to AP and assign the Invoice Owner or AP Processor / Manager group depending on the Access rules.

Incorrect accounting strings should be flagged and correct accounting strings should have the error message removed. Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTING_STRING_VALIDATION = true. What pages should this change impact?  Invoice in  Pending  status. Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Approvers with  or  without AP Coder  or  Edit AP documents during approval role. How should this change work? Pre-Requisites: Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. AP Processor / Manager submits the Invoice for Approval to the AP Approver. If the Accounting information on the invoice becomes invalid after the Invoice has been submitted then - The system re-triggers accounting validation for all  incorrect accounting strings  when the AP Approver accesses the Invoice - for the  first time  or; refreshes  the Invoice page if it was already open  or; if they had  AP Coder  /  Edit AP documents during approval  role and tried to update the accounting information using the calculator / pencil ( this already works seems like )  or; when they click on  Approve  /  Approve and Forward  button . The system discards the accounting string errors pertaining to the ones that are deemed valid. The system continues to display the accounting string errors pertaining to the ones that are still invalid. Currently, in this ticket -  , we are not handling accounting validation on Invoices in Pending status proactively. That's something we need to  extend  to Pending status as well. Reference ticket -   where accounting validation was done for certain Invoice statuses. 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  No, as this functionality is not available in Production. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 # Question Recommendation Response Remarks \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan \u00a01. Should we allow the AP Approver to approve the Invoice without resolving the accounting string error?",

        "description": "Client - Please see attached email. To summarize, we have several users calling in from multiple locations reporting that their default company code and/or default shipping address are loading incorrectly on new purchases. We think it may be only an issue on Catalog purchases but not 100% sure about that. As an example, look at user Mauricio Martinez. His default company is set to C1-031 but on the attached Word doc you can see it is populating as H1-060. Additionally, his default shipping address is loading incorrectly. This is much more serious. With the company code being wrong it is not allowing them to move forward if they don't have access to that company. But with the ship-to wrong and users not aware and being used to this always loading as their default, I am worried this could result in numerous purchases company-wide being shipped to the wrong places causing us not only delays in getting what we need but also to incur significant monetary expenses to correct and re-ship everything where it needs to go ... so we to give this the highest priority and get it resolved as quickly as possible. Support Team: When was this user's profile updated last time ? I don\u2019t believe I have updated it since it was created although I viewed it today. It seems like some changes have been made to users\u2019 profiles maybe through imports or something backend as I see a lot of things have changed I don\u2019t remember changing, specifically associated company codes being populated. Were there any Company Code restrictions added / removed from the user's profile? If yes, then which company code and when was this change made ? No changes that I am aware of, see answer above to  #1 . Which other users are having this issue so that we can compare their profiles and see what is common between them ? Chris Trahan, William Koenig, all users. The Shipping address in Mauricio's default setting and on the PR 1000127600 are the same. Is there an example where the wrong shipping address was selected ? That\u2019s probably because he manually changed it. On new purchases it is defaulting incorrectly. Some users will be astute enough to change it, some will not. Can you provide more PR examples if possible where users are getting the Shipping Address or Company Code issue ? If more issue are reported I will forward. Please consider this issue has URGENT Priority . Development Team: this issue is occurred due to user bulk upload and this is System bug. According to the current implementation,  System get first cost centre from the DB using provided cost centre code in the file, System doesn't check its configured with provided company code or not. this issue only happened if single cost centre is configured against multiple company codes. As you can see in the screenshot, this was implemented in 2015.",

These filter options should support filter by Status, and date range on the lastUpdatedDate field. status - APPROVED, PUBLISHED lastUpdatedDate - range                                  fromDate -                                    toDate - Technical Details: Add support for the following filtering options on the Catalogs GET API   /catalogs Add filtering by  Status , All Catalog Status can be passed as filters Support single status and multiple status, when providing multiple status, separate them by comma(,) If wrong value is provided in the status, there should be a validation error ignore the comma at the end of the filter e.g APPROVED and APPROVED, should result in same result APPROVED, PUBLISHED should filter all the catalogs in APPROVED and PUBLISHED status, the results are sorted by lastUpdatedDate Added filtering by lastUpdatedDate, when providing the filter by this date, there should be two fields to provide the date range, We already have the field  lastUpdatedAfter  exposed in the API, we need additional  lastUpdatedBefore . When providing the filter options, all the fields are optional. Id dates are provided than the following conditions should be considered only lastUpdatedAfter is provided in the filters, Return all results after this date, if the date is provided in date only format, consider the time of end of the day, e.g 01/29/2024 is provided than filter all records after 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000  only lastUpdatedBefore is provided in the filters, Return all results before this date, if the date is provided in date only format, consider the time of start of the day, e.g 01/29/2024 is provided than filter all records after 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 If both the dates are provided than consider the records between provided date ranges. If the date are provided in date only format, consider the following rule (lastUpdateAfter - lastUpdatedBefore). e.g  01/27/2024 t 00:00:00.000 - 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 will filter all the records from the 01/28/2024 If the fields are provided in wrong format, than we need to provide use with validation error, end date cannot be before start date.  the result will be empty, since there is nothing in the provided range e.g selecting (lastUpdateAfter - lastUpdatedBefore). e.g 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 - 01/27/2024 t 23:59:59.999 will return no result as there is nothing in between these dates (One suggestion could be to give a validation error, since this is not a correct date range.) Sort by should be by the last updated date field. Update the Vroozi API documentation to expose these additional query parameters. Dates should be accepted in the supported formats. Testing from Swagger UI and Postman should be performed.

When edit option is stored as REPLACE, and user will perform an action on the file, e.d upload the catalog items than only item provided in the catalog will be present in the catalog.

When catalog is updated from MERGE to REPLACE or vice versa and user is performing the action e.g APPROVE on catalog in working column, this will update catalog items based on the editOptions stored in the catalog. Public API documentation Update the documentation to expose the editOption field. Add following details to this field description editOption:\n  type: \"string\"\n  title: Edit option\n  description: Edit option of the catalog.</br>\n  In the context of the catalog API POST/PUT requests, only \"MERGE\" and \"REPLACE\" are accepted as valid values.
