During the execution of test cases, which involve sequential requests, I occasionally encounter authorization issues, causing test cases to fail. I'm uncertain whether this is a gateway or API issue. After discussing with the OPS team, we identified that throttling is enabled on the stage environment but not on the devQA environment. Despite this difference, we need to pinpoint the root cause of these intermittent authorization issues, as they are reproducible. Case 1: Executing on RC-2024-6 and response time of all the requests are 7:15 sec see below image top right corner. Case 2: Executing on RC-2024-7 and response time of all the requests are  17:28 sec see below image top right corner. Expected Result: The pre authentication does not slow the API executions.

      "description": "Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( \u2014 ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline.

The system attempts to notify the designated PO supplier of this change. This is happening because the system does not correctly identify these changes as ONLY being relevant to the Buying Organization. We need to update this logic, to be able to track which T&C changes the supplier should be notified of, versus which one\u2019s they should not be updated about.

The unitID must be configured to allow POCRs.  The unitID must be configured to allow changes to the T&Cs of a PO, via the POCR process.  The user doing the POCR must be a Buyer.  The Buyer must have the correct permissions; to create Ad-hoc T&Cs, assigned to them.  The PO being acted upon must have already been sent to a vendor.  The PO being acted upon must already have Ad-hoc T&Cs assigned to it.  What should happen when the user does a POCR, and updates the non-content portion of the assigned Ad-hoc T&Cs on a PO? In this scenario, the Buyer has ONLY updated the T&Cs on the PO, and specifically only the name, the description or both on the Ad-hoc T&Cs. Most importantly, the Buyer has NOT modified the content of the Ad-hoc T&Cs.  The system should record the change(s) made to the T&Cs and display them on the CR, and in the PO document history UI on the Buying org side.  The system should NOT \u2026  Update the PO version due to this change. Include the details of this change in the PO PDF (if communicated to the vendor).

The system is being updated to allow Admins to assign Company Code restrictions to AP Managers in their user profiles, limiting their access to specific Company Codes for Invoice and Memo document processing.

Given  an Admin is editing or creating a user profile for an AP Manager role, When  the Admin selects the AP Manager role for the user, Then  the system should automatically display the \"Company Code Restriction\" field in the Access section. Given  an Admin is assigning Company Code restrictions, When  the Admin selects Company Codes in the restriction field, Then  the Admin should only be able to select active and non-deleted Company Codes. Given  an AP Manager has no Company Code restrictions assigned, When  they access the system, Then  they should have access to Invoices and Memos belonging to all Company Codes, similar to the current system behavior.  (Default Setting) Given  an Admin is assigning Company Code restrictions to an AP Manager, When  the Admin selects one or more Company Codes in the \"Company Code Restriction\" field, Then  the AP Manager should only be able to view, take action on, and process Invoice and Memo documents associated with those selected Company Codes. Given  an AP Manager has Company Code restrictions applied to their profile, When  the Admin or AP Manager accesses the 'My Document Defaults' section in the 'Edit User' modal, Then  the 'Company Code' field should only display the Company Codes that have been assigned as restrictions in the Access section.

ANALYSIS : Looking at the data from all of our existing clients using the AP module, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone who has different set of document settings if there were multiple accounting categories active. Ignore Vroozi Validation in the screenshot provided below as it is our Test account on Production. In the screenshot below,  Required (ON) = The client is using this Accounting category and has made it a Required field. Required (OFF) = The client is not using this Accounting category but has it as a Required field in the BE. Optional (ON) = The client is using this Accounting category and has made it an Optional field. Optional (OFF) = The client is not using this Accounting category but has it as an Optional field in the BE. Hidden (ON) = The client is using this Accounting category and has made it a Hidden field. Hidden (OFF) = The client is not using this Accounting category but has it as a Hidden field in the BE. (ON) = The client is using this Accounting category but has no document setting choice selected (assuming PR line item config feature toggle is OFF) (OFF) = The client is not using this Accounting category and has no document setting choice selected (assuming PR line item config feature toggle is OFF) (Setting visible) = The client has the plant / purchasing org setting available for the Admin to select from the UI and accordingly they can choose Required / Optional / Hidden.

This can happen if the client is not using the PURCHASE__COMPANY_ACCOUNTING_LINE_ITEM_CONFIGURATION feature toggle. Implement the  same  behavior for the remaining accounting categories as well - WBS Element Internal Order Profit Center Apply All: Important Note:  The system exactly mimics the behavior of the Apply All modal of PRs. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Potentially no. Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes, invoices and memos that are currently in the early stages of the invoice process, e.g.   or   status. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date \u00a0How will the system behave if the accounting category is not selected, and Cost Center, WBS, Profit Center, and Internal Order are optional? The system should  not  show an error message, if all the accounting categories are optional, the user has not chosen an accounting category and then the user saves the line item. The user is allowed to save the line item without choosing the accounting category. \u00a0   \u00a08/19/2024 \u00a0   \u00a08/20/2024 # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 How should the system handle the scenario where lets say Cost Center is Required but WBSE is Optional or where Cost Center is Required but Internal Order is Hidden? What error message should be displayed? The assumption based on our present client data is that if more than one accounting category is turned ON for a client, then all of them will be set to Required, Optional, or Hidden at the same time. Although this is not a typical use case, it is possible to set up accounting categories that differ from one another. If this occurs, and at least one accounting category is set to Required, then the default error message will be displayed: Exactly one of 'Cost Center', WBS Element, Internal Order or Profit Center required. In this unusual scenario, the user must fill in both the Accounting Category and the Value field to resolve the error message after saving the line item. \u00a0 Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Should the behavior of \u201cApply All\u201c be changed? We should mimic the behavior that Purchase Team has developed.",

If the PR processing in external system toggle is enabled, the PR should move to submitted status after the Vroozi workflows are complete. PR should be visible and searchable in the approver UI screen. If sourcing review is enabled, it is automatically selected and PR will go to sourcing reviewer. Expose sourcingReviewerRef in the PR API. // We need to expose the approverRef in the PR as well Update public API documentation to reflect new fields. Update the confluence page to reflect the latest changes in the PR APIs. API Documentation updates: When a purchase request has only one eligible sourcing approver, the system automatically selects that sourcing approver. If multiple sourcing approvers are eligible to review or approve the purchase request, the user must select a valid sourcing reviewer or approver from the list generated by the system based on sourcing rules.",
