This change applies only to clients using the new feature toggle ( ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW__DOCUMENT_SETTINGS_CONFIGURATION ) and the customer accounting element. By default, the Customer field should remain optional for clients using the feature toggle. The system will only trigger document settings for the Customer field (whether required or optional) when a  combination of accounting elements  (such as company code, accounting category, GL account, or project) is  associated  with one or more  customer  accounting elements. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  The change ensures that the Customer field in AP documents becomes required or remains optional based on document settings,  triggered only when  accounting elements linked to a customer are present, for clients using the new feature toggle and customer accounting element. Which customers should this change impact? All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true, and All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true All customers who have PAYMENT_REQUEST = true What pages should this change impact?  The invoice, memo and payment request pages. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to edit an AP document. How should this feature work? Default Behavior : When the client is using the feature toggle ( ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW__DOCUMENT_SETTINGS_CONFIGURATION ) and the customer accounting element, the Customer field will be optional by default, regardless of the document settings. Triggering Document Settings : The system will check if the AP document line item contains accounting elements that are linked to a customer accounting element. If the accounting elements in the line item are associated with one or more customer accounting elements, the document settings will apply: If the document setting for the Customer field is set to \"Required,\" the field will become required.   If the document setting for the Customer field is set to \"Optional,\" the field will remain optional. The systems exhibits the current behavior. Document Settings Based on Accounting Elements : The system should evaluate combinations of accounting elements (e.g., company code, accounting category, GL account, or project) within the line item. If no valid combination of accounting elements linked to customer accounting elements exists, the Customer field will remain optional, regardless of the document settings. Apply to All : Apply to All implementation should work in a similar manner. Scope : This change applies only to clients using the new feature toggle and the customer accounting element feature. Next step (new ticket) - Fix the issue where customer value still remains in the field after removing one or more accounting elements from the line item that was associated with the customer. Make customer as a disabled / hidden field if the combination of accounting elements do no associate with any customer. If they associate with one or more customer, then the field will become active and allow the user to choose the customer value. Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  No. To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date",

All other connectors (such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, CSV, and Xero) that influence the Memo Posting View section are out of scope for this project. In the future, we will consider extending this logic to other connectors on this page as well. Please check with the Integration team developers to ensure there is no impact on their end when making this change. A spike ticket needs to be created to investigate why Resend, Edit Memo or Mark as \u2018Posted\u2019 options do not show up in the Memo Posting view page.
