In case only 1 item is updated in the catalog upload sheet (using \u201cMerge & Update\u201d method), still all the line items are moved into the history table and a new version is saved in the catalog table . This causes the history table to expand rapidly each time there is even a minor change in the catalog items. Use Case is: If a catalog has around 100,000 items Change price in 1 line item All items will have new lastUpdatedDate As there is no change in other items except 1. Implementation is updating all items. So it should only be updated and pushed into history with 1 item. Since we have a limited number of rows quota now. So based on the current implementation we can\u2019t move with this collection into redshift for replication. We may have to rethink the architecture that we have designed. Acceptance Criteria: Change the implementation, so that:  Instead of recording details about the entire catalog being edited, the system should ONLY record details of the items; within the catalog, that have been modified/added/deleted.  This new design needs to cover Overwrite All & Merge and update scenarios We need to handle catalogs in the WORKING column in the catalog manager. Catalogs can only be edited in that column. Modifying a catalog in the other columns is ONLY possible by either creating a \u201cworking\u201d copy, or uploading a new file \u2026 which then creates a working copy.  cc:  ,  ,  ,    QA  ONLY  needs to test the data replication from MongoDB to Amazon Redshift. There will be  NO  change to the change history report generated from the smartOCI Admin UI.   How to test this? There is a new DB collection, and that\u2019s all we need to look at. Only items that have been deleted from, or updated in a catalog should be added to that collection. Items that have NOT been modified, should NOT be part of that new collection.",

        "description": "Our mongo connector throws error and stops working whenever an  out of range date e.g. 20224  is added in  oplog.rs  table of the mongodb local database. Restarting mongo-connector also does not work unless we track and update this data. For right now we can produce this scenerio from invoice creation screen which is discussed in this ticket  . While the suggested validation in this ticket fixes the problem we need to identify and fix within mongo connector as well to support out of range dates or at least it should not crash and stop working. Reason for error: As mentioned in the official pyMongo documentation here at  https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/4.2.0/faq.html#why-do-i-get-overflowerror-decoding-dates-stored-by-another-language-s-driver  that this is a driver issue. The updated driver fixes this problem as mentioned here at  https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/4.3.2/faq.html#why-do-i-get-overflowerror-decoding-dates-stored-by-another-language-s-driver  by creating the MongoClient with customised date options. We need to solve this problem by using the pyMongo version 4.3.2 and then updating the native mongo-connector code to create MongoClient as mentioned in the documentation.  Both pyMongo versions are supported by mongodb 6 version as mentioned in the official documentation here at  https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/#compatibility-table-legend . Both pyMongo versions are also supported by python 3.8 which we are using for mongo-connector as mentioned in the official documentation here at  https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/pymongo/#language-compatibility . Fixation steps Update pyMongo from  4.2.0 to 4.3.2 Open connector.py file located at  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/mongo_connector/connector.py  and update the code as follows (updated file is also attached in this ticket) import  from bson.codec_options import DatetimeConversion  \u2192 around line 42 (file attached as well in the ticket) line number around 336 \u2192 replace code snipped as  https://github.com/yougov/mongo-connector/pull/938/commits/b2f96d3ed5c7fc5cc527567cff60a1f5a76fb648 client = MongoClient(new_uri, tz_aware=self.tz_aware, **kwargs) //original code\nclient = MongoClient(new_uri, tz_aware=self.tz_aware, \ndatetime_conversion=DatetimeConversion.DATETIME_CLAMP, **kwargs) //replacement Restart Mongo Connector.

All customers using the new Approval Workflow feature toggle. What pages should this change impact?  Company > Workflow > Approval Rules. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Admins. How should this change work? The system will determine the uniqueness of the Approval Rule by examining the Rule Name and considering the following use cases to determine whether the Approval rule being added via Bulk upload is a new rule or an existing rule that requires updating: - Bulk upload file contains a  new  rule : Rule Name , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does not exists  in the database. Approval Rule  does not belong to the  same  document type (Applies to) if the Combination of Conditions(s) or Approval Chain is the  same  to an existing Approval Rule. Example 1 :  Rule  = Exists in the system;  Rule Name  = Test 1;  Applies To  = PR, CR;   Condition(s)  = Company Code A + Plant A;  Approver(Approval Limit)  = Sujoy (100), Deepak (200).

Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does not exist  in the database. Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file, are valid, non-deleted and active. Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does not overlap  with an Existing Parent-Child combination(s). ( Similar to how existing implementation will check for a given combination of filter that is already in use by a workflow ) System assigns the  status  based on the use cases mentioned in this ticket -    Bulk upload file contains an  existing  rule : Rule Name , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does exists  in the database. Do not update existing Approval Rule  if - No changes in document type (Applies To). No changes in Rule Description. No changes in the Combination of Condition(s). No changes in the Approval Chain. No changes to the Status of the Approval rule. No changes to the Deleted option for the Approval rule, in the Bulk upload file. Update existing Approval Rule  if - Changes in document type (Applies To). Changes in Rule Description. Changes in the Combination of Condition(s). Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file,  does exist  in the database. Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file, are valid, non-deleted and active. Combination of the Condition(s) , provided in the Bulk upload file,  should not overlap  with an Existing Parent-Child combination(s). ( Similar to how existing implementation will check for a given combination of filter that is already in use by a workflow ) Changes in the Approval Chain. Note : Approvers should have proper user role, non-deleted, and active. Changes to the Status of the Approval Rule. Check the use cases mentioned in this ticket -    Changes to the Delete option for the Approval rule, in the Bulk upload file. Data provided, in the Bulk upload file, is Invalid or Incorrect : Throw an error for the Approval rule, to the user, explaining the reason for rejecting the Approval rule. Prompt the user to correct the data and re-upload correct data. Refer to the Error report ticket for more details -    User provides the same Approval rule multiple times in the Bulk upload file : Example : Rule 1 and Rule 2. If Rule 1 and Rule 2 are exactly the  same , then Check  \u201c Bulk upload file contains a  new  rule \u201d  use case . If it satisfies the above condition, then create a  new  Approval rule for  Rule 1 , and throw an  error  for  Rule 2 , to the user, in the Error report citing \u201c Duplicate Row Error \u201d. Check  \u201c Bulk upload file contains an  existing  rule \u201d  use case . If it satisfies the above condition, then  update  the existing Approval rule, using data provided in  Rule 1 , and throw an  error  for  Rule 2 , to the user, in the Error report citing \u201c Duplicate Row Error \u201d and hence ignore the duplicate data. Check  \u201c Data provided, in the Bulk upload file, is Invalid or Incorrect \u201d  use case. If it satisfies the above condition, then throw an  error  for  Rule 1  based on the various  error messages  provided in   or based on the  current implementation , that is present on the UI. Throw an  error  for  Rule 2 , to the user, in the Error report citing \u201c Duplicate Row Error \u201d and hence ignore the duplicate data. If Rule 1 and Rule 2 have  same   Rule Name  but  different   information  such as - \u201cApplies To / Rule Description / Combination of Condition(s) / Combination of Approval Chain / Status / Delete\u201d from each other, then Consider  Rule 1  as the  main data  and throw an  error  for  Rule 2 , to the user, in the Error report citing \u201c Duplicate Row Error \u201d and hence ignore the data provided in Rule 2. Check  \u201c Bulk upload file contains a  new  rule \u201d  and  \u201c Bulk upload file contains an  existing  rule \u201d  use case for  Rule 1  to see which use case it satisfies.

How should this change work? There should be an Upload Approval Rules icon above the top right corner of the Approval Rules table on the Approval Rules screen. ( The following image is just for reference. ) Hovering on the icon should show a tooltip saying Upload Approval Rules. Clicking on the Upload Approval Rules should open a window where users can select and upload the bulk upload file. Upon Selecting the file, the system should validate the bulk upload file to verify all the data is valid. In case of valid data in the bulk upload file, the system should save the Approval Rules uploaded via bulk upload in the DB. There should be a green noty message stating that the file has been uploaded successfully. They should start appearing in the Approval Rules table. If there are errors in the files, the system should generate an error report which the user can download. (refer to the ticket -  ). There should a red noty message stating that the file has been failed to upload or there are errors in the file. Here is the attached template file that should be used for the Approval Rules bulk upload. There is one optional column  Delete   in the bulk upload file. It is a flag type - (true or false). The user can use it to delete the existing record in the system through bulk upload. The user can provide  X   in the column to mark the  DELETED  flag true. The Approval Rule with the  DELETED  flag  true  should be soft-deleted and kept in the DB. The system should keep it in the DB with the  DELETED  flag true if the user marks the  DELETED  flag true for the Approval Rule that has never existed in the system before. Please open the  Instructions  of the attached sheet to understand the validations of each field (column) present in the bulk upload file. As an example for Company Code column, Admin can use any one of the below formats during  Upload : Company Code A Company Code A, Company Code B Company Code A | Company Code A description Company Code A | Company Code A description, Company Code B | Company Code B description Similarly other Accounting objects like - Plant, GL Account, Cost Center, Location and Project should be able to follow the same format as shown above for  Upload . The column names (fields) should be  case-insensitive . The system should support  custom labels  for accounting and company objects in the bulk upload file as column (field) names.  ( For now we\u2019ll skip custom label support for accounting objects which we can focus in a future release like RC-2024-4 or RC-2024-5 ) The system should support bulk upload file in .XLSX format.

General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Creation: Currently, the system requires the definition of the required and optional Accounting/Organization objects in the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service . If the value in the optional field is given at the line item, the system considers it for the accounting validation in addition to the required fields.

        "description": "Business Case: The system should run accounting validation when the PR is assigned to the awarded bid on the RFQ. Acceptance Criteria: Existing Implementation of RFQ: The user creates the RFQ with line items and sends the RFQ to one or more suppliers. The suppliers receive that RFQ via email. The suppliers then bid on the RFQ. The user who created the RFQ can see the bids from different suppliers on the RFQ. The user then can award the bid to one of the suppliers. The user then can assign the PR to the awarded bid. The system creates the PR in the DRAFT state in the background and assigns it to the selected requester. While creating the PR, the system assigns the accounting and organization objects from the selected user\u2019s profile. If the accounting and organization objects are not found in the user\u2019s profile, the system leaves the accounting and organization fields empty. The system shows the missing fields error message according to the document-level field configuration. General Rule for Running the Accounting Validation at Document Creation: Currently, the system requires the definition of the required and optional Accounting/Organization objects in the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service . If the value in the optional field is given at the line item, the system considers it for the accounting validation in addition to the required fields. If the value in the optional field is not given at the line item, the system considers only the values in the required fields at the line item for the accounting validation. Based on that, the system decided what fields should be compared in the accounting validation with the accounting string master data. Assign PR to the Awarded Bid of RFQ: The system creates the PR in the DRAFT state and assigns it to the selected requester when the PR is assigned to the awarded bid of the RFQ. While creating the PR in the background: The system should not run the accounting validation if the selected user default accounting/organization values are not set in the user\u2019s profile. In that case, when the requester opens(loads) the PR, the system should show the missing fields error message according to the document-level field configuration.   The system should not run the accounting validation if it does not find values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  in the selected user\u2019s profile.  In that case, when the requester opens(loads) the PR, the system should show the missing fields error message according to the document-level field configuration.   The system should run the accounting validation if it does find values in at least all the required fields for the  Accounting Validation Configuration Service  in the selected user\u2019s profile. If the system finds no accounting string errors, the system should save the state in the DB.

Note : When we hit at the same time only 150 records created with completed and rest of all the request in the response payload is working fine but when verify in db it state is IN_Progress but records are not created/ updated. This may be an issue in system. When we removed the item number in the csv file and upload it through API it gives us the validation error on UI. so user can pass any number in the item number it will not take this user provided number but system generates number automatically against line item  so i think this is incorrect behaviour we have to look into this one i already discuss with   bhai about this scenario.

These filter options should support filter by Status, and date range on the lastUpdatedDate field. status - APPROVED, PUBLISHED lastUpdatedDate - range                                  fromDate - 2024-01-25 \u2192 (2024-01-25t00:00:00.000Z)                                   toDate - 2024-01-26 \u2192 (2024-01-26t23:59:59.999Z) Technical Details: Add support for the following filtering options on the Catalog Items GET API  /catalogs /{id}/items and /catalogs/{name}/items Add filtering by  Status , All Catalog Status can be passed as filters Support single status and multiple status, when providing multiple status, separate them by comma(,) If wrong value is provided in the status, there should be a validation error ignore the comma at the end of the filter e.g APPROVED and APPROVED, should result in same result APPROVED, PUBLISHED should filter all the catalog items in APPROVED and PUBLISHED status, the results are sorted by lastUpdatedDate Added filtering by lastUpdatedDate, when providing the filter by this date, there should be two fields to provide the date range, We already have the field  Da  exposed in the API, we need additional  lastUpdatedBefore . When providing the filter options, all the fields are optional. If dates are provided then the following conditions should be considered only lastUpdatedAfter is provided in the filters, Return all results after this date, if the date is provided in date-only format, consider the time of the end of the day, e.g 01/29/2024 is provided than filter all records after 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 only lastUpdatedBefore is provided in the filters, Return all results before this date, if the date is provided in date only format, consider the time of the start of the day, e.g 01/29/2024 is provided then filter all records after 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 If both the dates are provided then consider the records between provided date ranges. If the date is provided in date only format, consider the following rule (lastUpdateAfter - lastUpdatedBefore). e.g 01/27/2024 t 00:00:00.000 - 01/29/2024 t 00:00:00.000 will filter all the records from the 01/28/2024 If the fields are provided in the wrong format, then we need to provide a validation error, the end date cannot be before the start date.  Sort by should be by the last updated date field. Update the Vroozi API documentation to expose these additional query parameters. Dates should be accepted in the supported formats. Testing from Swagger UI and Postman should be performed. Error Messages: https://smartoci.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TS/pages/3759243283/Error+Messages+and+Details",

      "description": "Description Objective: This Epic aims to significantly enhance the Terms & Conditions (T&Cs) management and assignment functionalities in our system, addressing specific needs of our clients, Yukon and Maersk. The primary goal is to provide flexibility and control in the creation, assignment, and management of T&Cs for Purchase Orders (POs), both auto-generated and manually created. Key Features: Admin Capabilities for T&Cs Management: Enable Company Admins to author and manage multiple custom T&Cs. Provide functionality to set default T&Cs and associate custom T&Cs with specific suppliers and/or company codes. Dynamic T&Cs Assignment: Automate the assignment of correct T&Cs to POs based on supplier and/or company code. Buyer Permissions & Capabilities: Empower Buyers with permissions to edit T&Cs on POs, including the use of a rich text editor for ad-hoc T&Cs, with options to save these either for single-use or in their profile for future reuse. PO Change Request (POCR) Enhancements: Implement functionality for Buyers to update T&Cs on POs via POCR, with tracking of changes in the document history UI. Restricted Access for Requesters: Prevent the original requester from altering T&Cs on POs through the POCR function. Admin Overrides and Approvals: Allow Admins to modify T&Cs on POs via POCR, subject to Buyer approval for manually created/transmitted POs. Stakeholders: Primary: Yukon and Maersk Vroozi Divisions: Management, Sales / Marketing, Customer Success, Implementation, Support, Product, Engineering Vroozi Functional teams: Purchase Team, Payables Team ( \u2014 ?), Integration Team ( ?) Timeline and Milestones: Start Date: ASAP Completion Target: May 2024, within Q2 2024 Dependencies and Risks: Application Roles Effected : Company Admins, Buyers Payables Team Cooperation: Required for updating POs in the Supplier Portal. Integration Team Involvement: Potential need for integrating T&Cs communication via cXML POs, which could impact project timeline. Success Criteria: Effective implementation of T&Cs management and assignment system enhancements. Improved flexibility and control for Admins and Buyers in handling T&Cs. Seamless integration with existing systems and processes. Positive feedback from primary stakeholders, Yukon and Maersk. Milestones: MVP - Minimum Viable Product: Product manager to validate assumptions and solution design with stakeholders. Engineering to complete    MUP - Minimum Useable Product:                                     Purchase Order: Allow Buyers to create and associate Ad-hoc T&Cs to a specific PO Purchase Order: Print the correct T&Cs on the PO PDF Vroozi Admin: Allow Admins to specify whether PO T&Cs can be updated via the POCR function POCR: Allow only the \u201cPO Owner\u201d to update T&Cs via POCR POCR: Record and display T&Cs changes done on a PO, in the PO Document Change History Integration team  \u2192 SPIKE: Integration team needs to investigate impact on NBCU, if T&Cs can be updated vai POCR Payables team  \u2192 Supplier Portal: Display PO T&Cs in the Vroozi Supplier Portal Payables team  \u2192 Supplier Portal: Ensure SP users are able to Confirm / Dispute T&Cs changes on a PO updated via POCR MLP - Minimum Lovable Product: Vroozi Admin: Figure out how to introduce an \u201cApply to All\u201d option for associations SPIKE: Investigate how we can compute, store and display a fine grained \u201cDiff\u201d for the T&Cs content, when updated by an Admin         Integration team  \u2192     POCR: Allow Admins to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Allow Central Reciever to update the T&Cs on a PO via POCR POCR: Ensure that T&Cs updates on POs; done via POCR, are reviewed and approved by the \u201cPO Owner\u201d Vroozi PMAN: Allow Buyers, Admins, Central Receivers to create custom T&Cs and save them in their user profile for reuse at a later date Vroozi PMAN: Allow users to view and manage their custom T&Cs from their \u201cMy Data\u201d screen \u00a0 The wireframes for this project can also be found here:",

        "summary": "Vroozi Admin : Add a table to display a list of custom T&Cs in the unitID",
        "description": "Business Case: The purpose of this ticket is to address the need for an enhanced user interface within the Vroozi Admin system for displaying custom Terms & Conditions (T&Cs). The current UI for T&Cs is slated for replacement to improve usability, functionality, and visual appeal. This enhancement is expected to facilitate easier navigation and management of T&Cs for administrators, particularly in the context of different unit IDs. By introducing a new table format, administrators can efficiently view, manage, and understand the specific T&Cs associated with each unit ID, leading to better compliance management and a more user-friendly experience. What\u2019s wrong with the current UI?   The current UI is only meant to handle a single set of custom T&Cs for a unitID. It displays a single rich text editor, which allows the Admins to define the custom T&Cs that the unitID will use. This bakes in the assumption that there will always be just one set of T&Cs that will be used across all POs that the unitID issues to all suppliers.  What value will the updated UI bring? This new UI will be inspired by other data tables used in the application, specifically the ones used on the various document status screens. E.g. Purchase Orders. This will enable the display, creation, deletion, editing of an arbitrary number of custom T&Cs that an Admin might want to maintain for the unitID.  The data table format will allow the system to list any number of custom T&Cs for the unitID. Allowing the Admin to perform various operations on these T&Cs, either on a singular basis, or collectively. The new UI will support standard CRUD functionality, and will even grow to offer bulk upload/download functionality.  Acceptance Criteria: Prerequisites: If the feature flag added in   has not been removed from the system. Then the unitID MUST have this feature flag enabled.    Impacted Vroozi Roles Which user roles within the Vroozi Admin system will be affected by this change? PMAN Admin Data-Fix Necessity   Will there be any requirement for data migration or transformation as part of this change? TBD \u2026 If required, please provide details of what the expected effect of this data fix will be:  TBD \u2026 Change this \u2026  To this \u2026                                                                                +  Ignore the following UI elements from the wireframes for the scope of this ticket: The Bulk Upload/Download UI controls The Default Terms & Conditions label and drop-down The search/filter bar Default set of requirements for the new data table: When a user clicks into the existing \u201c Terms & Conditions \u201c drop-down and selects the \u201c Custom Terms & Conditions \u201c option, the system should display a new data table, with the following columns:  <Row selection checkboxes> Name Description Associated with \u2026  Created by Created on Status <Row action controls> The following columns should be sortable:  Name Created by Created on There should be 3 action buttons under the data grid:  Activate Deactivate Add T&Cs How should the system behave when there are no custom T&Cs available in the unitID? If there are no custom T&Cs currently created for the unitID, the system should display a placeholder message in lieu of the rows in the table. This message should read \u201c Could not find any existing custom Terms & Conditions. Please create a new set of Terms & Conditions by clicking on \"Add T&Cs\".  \u201c Unless there is at least 1 set of custom T&Cs in the data table, only the \u201c Add T&Cs \u201d button should be in an active/clickable state.  How should the system behave when 1 or more custom T&Cs are available in the unitID? By default, the system should display custom T&Cs on this data table, sorted by creation date; i.e. the \u201c Created on  \u201c column, in reverse chronological order (latest \u2192 oldest). The  Name  field should display the mandatory name assigned to each set of custom T&Cs.  The value displayed in this column should be clickable The  Description  field should display upto 50 characters from the optional description in each set of custom T&Cs, if available.  The  Associated with \u2026  field should display upto 3 of the suppliers and/or company codes that the custom T&Cs are associated with.  If there is a single supplier and/or company code that the custom T&C is associated with, then the system should just list those values. If there is nothing to show, display an \u201c N/A \u201d. For 2 or more values display the keyworkd \u201cMultiple ( x )\u201c; where \u201cx\u201d is the number of values that were returned by the BE.  Upon clicking on this keyword, the system should display a list of the values represented by the count in the (), in a too-tip. See the implementation on the Purchase Orders data grid for ference.  The associated suppliers should be listed first, followed by the associated company codes in the next line.  The  Created by  column should list the name of the user that created a given set of custom T&Cs.  The  Created on  column should list the date on which a given set of custom T&Cs was created in the unitID. This field should use the same default date format used in the entire unitID.  The  Status  column should display one of the following statuses for each row: Active Inactive Question Answer Q asked by \u2026  Q asked on \u2026 A provided by \u2026 A provided on \u2026 What symbol should be added to the last column\u2019s header in the new table? Leave the header empty for now. If needed, I\u2019ll create another ticket to add a symbol there.          What are the options that we will show in the action menu in the last column in the new table? Ultimately, I want 3 options in the menu: Make these the default T&Cs  Copy Delete However, this will be handled in a separate ticket. For now, just make sure there\u2019s an extra column at the end of the table, that we can use to give the user options for performing actions related to a given set of T&Cs.",

        "description": "As an API user We need to support the insertion of catalog items though JSON payload. https://staging-api.vroozi.com/v1/catalogs/{id/externalId}/items/async?version=2 https://staging-api.vroozi.com/v1/catalogs/name/{name}/items/async?version=2 Acceptance Criteria: Limit the items to 5000 , (AWS payload size limit is 10MB) The size of the payload needs to be adjusted after testing, keeping in view the 10MB hard limit on the API gateway payload size. Perform all the required validations and error report Support the header parameter update-strategy with MERGE and REPLACE options. Catalog will store this information in editOption field. Use the stored value. If this is passed in the header than use the header value as preference. If the catalog stored with other values like NEW or COPY, or OTHER, than use the value from header or default to MERGE. Convert this payload into existing catalog file template that can be processed  async Expose the AsycnRequest object in response that will include the requestId, which can be used to track the progress of this async request. {\n  \"requestId\": \"123-2123\",\n  \"status\": \"Processing\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-03-15T13:56:04.037+0000\"\n} We need to expose the status tracking end point. Details of the end point - expose the end point  /catalogs/request-tracking/{requestId} The client should be able to get the status by polling. Expose the end point to download the error report. Details of the error report end point - /{requestId}/report  (Separate ticket for error report need to rework as name in template and API does not match.) Store the request and errors in the async_requests collection with requestId. We can store the payload to a separate collection async_requests_payload In the API description, we need to add the following information V ersion is optional field for identifying the correct catalog for which we want to upsert these items. There could be multiple version of the catalog in different columns. If the version is not provided we will consider the latest catalog version for the update. If you want to update specific version of the catalog, please provide in the optional query parameters which version of the catalog should be updated.  If the provided id/externalId/name does not exist, we give validation error {\n    \"id\": \"b459ab18-4420-4745-af22-ff15e20c432c\",\n    \"status\": \"404\",\n    \"title\": \"Not Found\",\n    \"errors\": [\n        {\n            \"code\": \"404\",\n            \"element\": \"id/externalId/name\",\n            \"message\": \"Record [catalog] not found.\",\n            \"detail\": \"Record [catalog] not found.
