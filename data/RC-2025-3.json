The layout has been adjusted so that all items are now fully visible. Inconsistent Scrolling:  The scrolling behavior of the carousel was inconsistent. Users had to click multiple times to reveal items, and sometimes the scrolling would only move a small amount. This has been resolved to provide smooth and predictable scrolling with a single click. Suggested Enhancements: Dynamic Card Display:  The number of item cards displayed in the carousel now dynamically adjusts based on screen size. This ensures optimal use of screen space and displays up to five items on larger screens. Hover-to-Show Navigation:  Navigation icons are hidden by default and only appear when the user hovers over the \"Similar Items\" area. When hovering near the edge, the icon changes to an arrow, and upon clicking, the carousel smoothly navigates to the next item with a single click. Mobile Device Improvements: Smaller navigation icons have been implemented for better usability on smaller screens. Touch-enabled scrolling (drag and drop) has been added for touch devices, as hovering is not applicable. Video Recording",

Another user with only the  Sourcing Approver  role (e.g., XYZ user). Set the ABC user as the  Fallback Approver  as well as the  Alternate Approver  for the XYZ user. Enable the  Financial Workflow  and  Sourcing Workflow . Create and configure a  Sourcing Rule  with the XYZ user, with an amount limit of $50. Set the employee spend limit (e.g., $100). Create and submit a  Purchase Request  that exceeds the requester's spend limit and qualifies for  Sourcing Review . Ensure the system shows two approvers: one  Sourcing Approver  and one  Financial Approver . Steps to Reproduce: Log in to PMAN as the  Alternate Approver  user (ABC user). Load the above  Purchase Request  and approve it. Verify the  Purchase Request  status and  Approval Status History . Actual Result: The system shows the  Purchase Request  in  Financial Review  status, and the  Approval Status  indicates that it is approved by all users.

PMAN Admins can download all users across all User Groups and upload or update users with any valid User Group without restrictions. User Group Admins can only download users linked to their User Group and are restricted to uploading or updating users within their assigned User Group, with errors thrown for unauthorized User Groups.

These restrictions must be reflected in the Supplier Bulk upload and download functionality to maintain consistency and proper access control. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change?

No changes to their Supplier Bulk upload behavior; they can create or update suppliers with one or more valid User Groups.

Once the User Group is selected, dynamic behavior must apply to reflect settings such as SDM Label, Project (Production), Enable EF Access, and SDM Locations for the selected User Group. This approach aligns with the logic implemented for the SDM User modal, with slight differences in workflow prioritization. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? Maintain existing behavior on the PMAN user modal where the  User Group  field only appears after the PMAN Admin selects an SDM role in the  Access  section. Display the  Default Setting SDM Label  (e.g., \"Supplier Discovery Admin\") to the PMAN Admin by default, regardless of whether an SDM role is selected.

Existing Behavior (Current Implementation -    ) PMAN Admin must select an SDM role (e.g., SDM Admin, SDM Power User, etc.) first. After selecting the SDM role, the  User Group  field appears as a mandatory field in the  Access  section. Dynamic Updates After SDM Role and User Group Selection: Once the PMAN Admin selects an SDM role: The  User Group  field appears as a mandatory field. The PMAN Admin selects a User Group (e.g., Redbook, Directory). Based on the selected User Group, the following dynamic updates apply: SDM Label:  Updates to reflect the User Group's SDM Label (e.g., \"Redbook Admin,\" \"Directory Basic User\"). Project (Production): If turned OFF for the selected User Group, Project (Production) fields are hidden in the user modal. Enable EF Access: If turned OFF for the selected User Group, EF-related sub-roles (e.g., EF Approval) are hidden in the user modal.

To simplify and improve usability, the SDM Label should dynamically update based on User Group selection, and specific restrictions should be enforced for suppliers linked to multiple User Groups. Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? PMAN Admins  can view, create, edit, and delete all suppliers across all User Groups. SDM Label  dynamically updates based on User Group selection when creating or editing suppliers. User Group Admins  can view, create, and edit suppliers linked only to their User Group.

PMAN Admin SDM Admin Example: Redbook Admin (User Group 1 = Redbook) Example: Directory Admin (User Group 2 = Directory) How should this feature work? PMAN Admin Behavior: PMAN Admins  can view, create, edit, and delete all suppliers in  Master Data > Suppliers , regardless of User Group associations. For new suppliers: Default Behavior:  The  Default Setting SDM Label  is displayed initially. If the PMAN Admin selects  User Group A (Redbook) , the system updates the SDM Label dynamically to the  User Group A SDM Label . If the PMAN Admin selects  User Group B (Directory) , the system updates the SDM Label dynamically to the  User Group B SDM Label . If multiple User Groups (e.g., Redbook and Directory) are selected, the system reverts to the  Default Setting SDM Label  for simplicity. Example Scenarios: Scenario 1:  SDM toggle OFF \u2192 SDM Label shows \"Default Label.\" Scenario 2:  SDM toggle ON but no User Group selected \u2192 SDM Label shows \"Default Label.\" Scenario 3:  Redbook selected \u2192 SDM Label updates to \"Redbook Label.\" Scenario 4:  Redbook + Directory selected \u2192 SDM Label reverts to \"Default Label.\" PMAN Admins can link one or multiple User Groups to a supplier. User Group Admin Behavior: User Group Admins  (e.g.,  Redbook Admin ,  Directory Admin ) can view, create, and edit suppliers linked only to their respective User Group. When a User Group Admin creates a new supplier: The system automatically links the supplier to their User Group (e.g., Redbook Admin links the supplier to Redbook). The SDM Label dynamically updates to the  User Group SDM Label  (e.g., Redbook Label). The  User Group field  is hidden from the User Group Admin's view. User Group Admins cannot view or edit suppliers linked to other User Groups. Multi-User Group Linked Supplier Behavior: If a supplier is linked to  multiple  User Groups (e.g.,  Redbook  and  Directory ): Both User Group Admins can view the supplier in  Master Data > Suppliers . The delete icon and activate/deactivate checkbox for such suppliers are disabled. Replace the  delete icon  with a tooltip: Tooltip:  \"This supplier cannot be deleted or deactivated as it is shared across multiple User Groups.

Acceptance Criteria: What is the change? Implement a typeahead dropdown in the SDM settings to switch between Default and User Group-specific settings.

PMAN Admin SDM Admin Example: Redbook Admin (User Group 1 = Redbook) Example: Directory Admin (User Group 2 = Directory) How should this feature work? Add User Group Dropdown Add a typeahead dropdown field \u201c User Group \u201d in the SDM Settings to select between  Default  and  User Group-specific  settings. Default User Group Functionality The  Default User Group  serves as the company-wide settings, preserving the current system view and functionality for PMAN Admins who are not tied to specific User Groups. The  Default User Group  is not a record in  Master Data > User Groups  but exists as a system-managed baseline for default settings. Settings Navigation When a  PMAN Admin  navigates to the Settings section, the  Default  option should be pre-selected in the User Group dropdown. PMAN Admins  can: Change the selection to view or manage other User Groups' settings. Select Default settings or a specific User Group to view and manage its settings. Customize settings for any User Group. User Group Admins  can only: Manage their assigned User Group settings. Customize settings for their assigned User Group. Example : User Group 1 = Redbook Redbook Admin can only view/edit Redbook settings. User Group 2 = Directory Directory Admin can only view/edit Directory settings. New User Group Creation When a new User Group is created in  Master Data > Users > User Group , the system automatically inherits all  Default settings  into the new User Group\u2019s settings. Changes made to  Default settings  after a User Group is created  do not impact  existing User Group settings. Customizable Fields All other fields in the settings, such as Email Body, Email Subject, Company Logo, Login Page Background, Sourcing Emails, etc., can be customized to suit each User Group's specific needs after the Default settings have been inherited. Exceptions SSO Button Link / SSO Login Button Link Behavior: PMAN Admins  can update these fields in any User Group settings, including the Default User Group. Changes made to these fields in any User Group settings (Default or specific) automatically  propagate  across all User Group settings. For  User Group Admins , these fields are  read-only  and  cannot  be edited. Notes : SSO Button Link  is available in  Email Settings  for both  Module Type = Purchasing Manager  and  Supplier Discovery  under  Email Type = Welcome Mail . SSO Login Button Link  is available under  Company Settings . Login Page URL Pattern:   Auto-populated with the  User Group name  (spaces replaced with hyphens \u201c-\u201d) upon User Group creation. This field can be customized for each User Group after creation. Default settings  will include a Login Page URL Pattern (\"Supplier-Discovery\") for new clients, editable by PMAN Admin. Note :  For  NBCU , the  Redbook User Group  may need to be created, and the  Default setting's Login Page URL Pattern  manually updated to distinguish between the Default and Redbook URLs. Login Process: The system should allow a user to log in using any valid  Login Page URL Pattern  as long as their credentials are correct. The  Login Page URL Pattern  itself should not restrict login for users associated with other User Groups. Example : A Redbook user logging in via the Directory URL should still be authenticated based on their credentials. Post-Login Behavior: Once logged in, users should see the views, settings, and data appropriate for their User Group based on their user profile. Example : A Redbook user will only see Redbook-specific views and settings, even if they logged in via a Directory URL. Supplier Discovery Label: Auto-filled with the User Group name upon User Group creation. This field can also be customized for each User Group after creation.

Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date Can we make the login button editable on all user groups including the default user group for PMAN Admins so that they can make changes to this field from any screen possible? But we would need to add a tool tip for added context as well as keep the field read-only for SDM Admins for their user groups. Yes, PMAN Admins can edit the SSO Button Link and SSO Login Button Link fields from any User Group settings screen, including Default. Changes made on any screen will propagate across all User Groups. These fields will remain read-only for SDM Admins. The ticket description has been updated to include this clarification along with tooltips for context.   1/21/2025   1/21/2025 Can you please add in the ticket that the login process also needs to be handled in this ticket itself for login page URL? Also, do we need to validate the User Groups with the credentials at the time of login? I\u2019ve updated the description to include handling the login process using the Login Page URL Pattern. The system will validate credentials during login but will not restrict access based on the URL used.

No, an error message is not required since the system will validate credentials regardless of the User Group Link used, and users will see their appropriate views post-login.   1/21/2025   1/22/2025 Can you please clarify in the ticket on how the Default User Group is supposed to function or what its role is? I've updated the description of the ticket to clarify the role and functionality of the Default User Group, ensuring its purpose and behavior are clearly defined.   1/21/2025   1/22/2025 # Question Recommendation Response Remarks \u00a0 For now, the quick way to handle the login process would be that any SDM login URL can be used for now in order for the user to log in to the system. We would not do a URL + User Group check to see if the right person is logging into their profile. This can be done in the future but removing the requirement from the ticket itself will help expedite the solution for this project.  I have considered this solution and updated the Acceptance Criteria accordingly to reflect that any SDM login URL can be used for login without a URL + User Group check. Post-login behavior will align with the user's User Group settings.",

All the payload should be properly formatted and should work using Try it from documentation itself. Add the read only fields in the default response to mention them as Read only fields, e.g id, dateCreated, lastUpdated etc. It is read only field. Mention the behaviour of the field in case the value is not provided in the payload for update flows. e.g Not providing a field at all in the payload vs providing empty or null value in that field during update. Update the 403 error message in the documentation Forbidden (The server understood the request but refuses to authorise it). Add the following Note in the API description During an update request, only the fields provided in the payload will be updated. Any field not included in the payload will retain its previous value. To reset a field's value, include that field in the payload with a value of null or an empty string.
