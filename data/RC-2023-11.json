        "description": "User Story: As an Admin , I want the system the system to include or exclude Shipping Charges and Tax for workflow determination  so that  a given document is routed to the appropriate Approvers for approval, ensuring a 100% compliance with our business processes. Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system takes the settings to include or exclude Shipping Charges and Tax on the Company \u2192 Workflow page and routes to the appropriate Approvers for approval. 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true  and  the new workflow rules feature toggle = true. Important Notes:   The new workflow enhancements will only be enabled for Maersk initially. For all other customers for whom this will be turned off, the existing functionality will prevail (for both Vroozi Invoice and Purchase). 3.  What pages should this change impact?  The documents themselves, when they are routed for approval. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?  AP Approvers. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Financial Approval Workflow is enabled by the Admin. A document is ready to be submitted for approval  or  is already in the approval chain, manually or to be auto-submitted by the system. Exclude Tax Exclude Tax = On: The system excludes Tax from the workflow determination, that is, the system subtracts Tax from the Document Total. Exclude Tax = Off: The system includes Tax from the workflow determination, that is, the system does  not  subtract Tax from the Document Total. Exclude Shipping Charges Exclude Shipping = On: The system excludes Shipping from the workflow determination, that is, the system subtracts Shipping from the Document Total. Exclude Shipping = Off: The system includes Shipping from the workflow determination, that is, the system does  not  subtract Shipping from the Document Total. Approval Determination The system uses the finally computed Total to determine which Approvers should approve the document with everything else being the same. 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Potentially yes. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  In general, yes. But, existing documents for Maersk will not be impacted as they have turned these settings off, that is, Tax and Shipping are included by default for workflow determination. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Test Data: Approval Chain: Level Approver Approval Limit #1 John $80 #2 James $100 #3 Tim $110 #4 Jim $125 System Behavior: Total Tax = Tax (At footer) + Use Tax (At footer, if it is enabled) # Scenario Total Tax Total Shipping Document Total Document Total considered for approvers determination Approvers document is forwarded to\u2026 1 Exclude Tax = Off Exclude Shipping = Off $10 $15 $125 $125 L1: John L2: James L3: Tim L4: Jim 2 Exclude Tax = On Exclude Shipping = On $10 $15 $125 $100 L1: John L2: James 3 Exclude Tax = Off Exclude Shipping = On $10 $15 $125 $110 L1: John L2: James L3: Tim 4 Exclude Tax = On Exclude Shipping = Off $10 $15 $125 $115 L1: John L2: James L3: Tim L4: Jim Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date # Question Recommendation Response Remarks Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 How should we handle existing documents that are already in the approval process? At every event, e.g. approve, submit, etc,. the approvals routing will be determined based on the latest settings. This is current state and it makes sense. None. 2 How should we handle the Withholding Tax and Use Tax scenarios? Do we need to add separate toggles? Both should be included or excluded. Both of these constitute the Total Tax being paid out by AP. Most customers will want both PR and invoice approval to mimic each other. 3 How should we handle Special Handling charges? Special Handling is inserted into the Shipping Charges. It will be included or excluded based on the Shipping Charges setting. There is no way to differentiate this scenario.  Backlog Grooming (October 24, 2023): Points of Discussion: Discussed the scope of the ticket. Reviewed the decision points collectively. Backlog Grooming (November 7, 2023): Attendees:  Jaro, Mavin, Jimena, Ahmed, Asma, Aqsa, Zulkiful, Sujoy, Deepak Points of Discussion: Discussed and answered all the decision points.

Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system showcases Purchasing Organization field and all of its associated messages only if this new feature toggle is enabled; otherwise, it is  not . 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true (and ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW_MEMO = true, if memos are enabled). Note:  The feature toggle is applied to both invoices and memos alike. 3.  What pages should this change impact?  The invoice and memos pages. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?   Users who are allowed to create AP documents, namely, AP Processors, Managers, and Admins, will be able to update the Purchasing Organization field in   and    status, and Users who are allowed to view AP documents. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The Purchasing Organization setting in Documents \u2192 Settings \u2192 All Documents is configured to one of Optional or Required. Default:  This feature toggle should be set to  off  for all existing and new customers, by default. Feature Toggle = Off When a user creates or views an AP document, the system does  not  showcase the Purchasing Organization field in the  line item  and in the  Audit Trail , and does not showcase any associated messages. Feature Toggle = On On the contrary, when a user creates or views an AP document, the system showcases the Purchasing Organization field in the  line item  and allows the user to make changes. The system also showcases any associated error messages above the line item section. The system reflects changes done to it in the  Audit Trail . 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes \u2013 both documents in process and historically processed documents. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date # Question Recommendation Response Remarks Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 How should we handle documents created between RC-2023-11 and RC-2024-1? The Purchasing Organization will be null if the feature toggle is off. Since the user is not explicitly setting it, it doesn\u2019t make sense for the system to set it behind the scenes. None. 2 Identical to the question above, how should we handle the situation when the feature toggle is enabled initially and then disabled at a later point? The latest settings will take effect on documents being processed. This might not apply as the feature toggle will be deprecated when this is rolled out to Production. None.

Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 Can we turn off Purchasing Organization from anywhere in the UI or back-end? No. Just the one in the Documents \u2192 Settings \u2192 All Documents. 2 Would this have any impact on Accounting Validation feature we built? Probably not. 3 How would adding the Purchasing Organization impact the Apply All modal? Should not have any unforeseen impact. 4 Where is the Purchasing Organization in the Purchasing Parties populated from? Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Do we need a add a feature toggle for this change? No, this can be released to all customers at the same time. 2 Should Purchasing Organization be added to the SP? No. This is not relevant for SP users. 3 How should we handle existing documents (documents in process + processed documents) when the change is released in Production? In   and   status, existing documents will reflect the latest configuration. 4 How should we handle documents in process when Purchasing Organization is enabled-disabled, after being enabled initially? In   and   status, existing documents will reflect the latest configuration. 5 How to handle the scenarios when Purchasing Organization = Hidden, that is, should Purchasing Organization = null in the database? Let it remain as-is. Unclear on what the customer expectations are in various scenarios. Understand customer expectations pre-release. 6 Do we need to consider the Accounting filtering feature toggle for the implementation? How does Plant filtering work? No. 7 Where should the Purchasing Organization error message be placed? Along with the Plant error message.

The system should check the Accounting String Configuration Service to determine which the  Company Info  fields are required.  There should be the following fields in the  Company Information  section based on the above-mentioned criteria: The Company Object fields should be a type ahead. The system should fetch only non-deleted active company codes that match the entered phrase in the field. The admin should be able to select one of the available company objects in the type ahead. Under the above Company Information fields, there should be a line separator. Under the Line Separator, There should be a subheading for the section. The subheading should be  Accounting Information.

The system should check the Accounting String Configuration Service to determine which  Accounting Info  fields are required.  If there is any Cost Object defined in the Accounting String Configuration Service, the system should show the  Account Category  dropdown in the  Company Information  section. Suppose only one cost object is defined in the Accounting String Configuration Service. In that case, that object should be auto-selected in the  Account Category  dropdown, and its type ahead field should automatically be visible beneath the  Account Category  dropdown. If there is more than one cost object defined in the Accounting String Configuration Service, the user must select the cost object type from the  Account Category  dropdown. Based on the Cost Object selection in the  Account Category  dropdown, the system should start displaying the selected cost object field beneath the  Account Category  dropdown. All of the  Accounting Information  fields should be a Type Ahead. The system should fetch only non-deleted active accounting objects that match the entered phrase in the field. The admin should be able to select one of the available options in the type ahead. The system should show their custom labels in the  Accounting Strings  table if the custom label is defined for any company and, or accounting objects.  The admin should be able to close the  Accounting String  modal by clicking: ESC button on the keyboard. X icon on the top right corner of the modal. Cancel  button Closing the  Accounting String  modal from any of the avenues mentioned above should not save the accounting string in the DB. The admin should be able to save the  Accounting String  by clicking the  Save  button. The  Accounting String  should be saved in the DB. The admin should be able to see that  Accounting String  on the  Accounting String   Listing  screen. The system should show a green noty message upon accounting string creation. The message should say \u201cNew Accounting String \u201cstrinName\u201c created successfully.\u201c The noty message should be a slider. ( standard existing implementation ) Not Required in this Ticket: All these fields on the Accounting String modal should be filled in with the values for each string that come from API (The Integration team will work on this). If any company or accounting info field is empty, the system should display \u201c-\u201c for the object.",

        "description": "As an API user, we need to expose the feature to open a purchase order for re-invoicing when a memo is created. This can be achieved through the following ways: Acceptance Criteria: Reopen For Invoicing Field Support : The  reInvoicingOption  field should be exposed in the public API to manage the behavior of purchase orders when creating a memo. Allowed Values : The  reInvoicingOption  field should accept the following three values: REOPEN_PO (internal enum value: REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : This option allows the items in the memo to be available for invoicing, and the purchase order status will be changed to the previous status before it was invoiced. DONOT_REOPEN_PO (Internal enum value: DO_NOT_REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : This option ensures that the items won't be available for invoicing, and the purchase order status will remain unchanged. KEEP_AS_IS (internal enum value: ALLOW_REOPEN_FOR_INVOICING) : When this option is selected, the purchase order status will be kept as is, but the items will be made available for invoicing. Default Behavior : The value represents user selection for one of the options available for the re invoicing. If the user does not provide any value for this field, it should be null and not set.  The API should accept one of the supported values ( REOPEN_PO, DONOT_REOPEN_PO, KEEP_AS_IS ) in this field as the user selected value. If user does not provide any value in this field, it should not be set and user should be able to update this in the memo update scenario Accounts Payable Workflow (AP Workflow) :? Is this valid use case where the AP workflow is ON and we are creating the Memo from the API, since this will not trigger the AP workflow and Memo will be directly create in POSTED status from API. Do we need to add any validation in case of AP workflow ON, since we could add validation for supported values based on the AP settings If the AP settings support either PO reopen for invoicing or undetermined or both than the Memo creation is not possible without a user selection (purchaseOrderReInvoicingType will be mandatory in this case.) The public API documentation should be updated and following details should be provided into the  documentation. Development Tasks: Expose the  reInvoicingOption  field in the public API. Implement validation to ensure the field accepts the specified values. Implement default behavior based on AP workflow and CompanySettings. Update the documentation, and also update the minor version in the API documentation and add the change to release notes. Testing Tasks: Verify that the  reInvoicingOption  field is exposed in the API. Test that the field accepts the specified values ( REOPEN_PO, DONOT_REOPEN_PO, KEEP_AS_IS ). Validate that the default behavior is correctly determined based on the AP workflow and CompanySettings. Conduct thorough testing to ensure the feature works as expected. QA Testing Criteria: Verify that the API endpoints for creating memos have been updated to include the  reInvoicingOption  field. Confirm that the specified values are accepted and result in the expected behaviours. Validate that default behavior is correctly determined based on the AP workflow and CompanySettings. Perform end-to-end testing to ensure that creating a memo correctly impacts the purchase order re-invoicing. API documentation updated AC We need to update the API release notes and add on the top of the release notes following details. version of the API should be updated to 1.2.0 Memo[Memo](/#/Memos) APIs are updated to support Re Invoicing Options. The link should take the user to the Memo section in the documentation MemoModel should have the reInvoicingOption field",

        "description": "Business Case : When an Invoice document is sent to a user for Exception Handling due to Accounting String errors or for Coding purposes (in general), then there should be a way for the next user (such as an AP user), viewing this document, to understand what changes were made by the previous user. Acceptance Criteria : What is the change?  Anybody who can view audit logs should be able to see this banner on the document and they should be navigated to the audit logs after clicking on this banner. Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true. What pages should this change impact?  The invoice page. Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to handle exceptions and view audit logs. How should this change work? If the  Exception Handler  resolves the Accounting string errors by changing the accounting elements, and  submits  the invoice, then the system should showcase a new  Banner  indicating  Accounting Information Changes , which when clicked on, will open the  Audit trail  and highlight the line item Change Summary where the changes were made. If the  AP Coder  makes changes to the accounting elements in an Invoice, when it is in  Coding  or  Exception  status, then the same thing should happen as mentioned above. When should the Banner  show up ? After the  Exception Handler  or  AP Coder  has  submitted  the Accounting changes, when the Invoice was in  Exception  or  Coding  status. If there is an Audit Trail generated for the Accounting changes in the Change Summary section. Then ideally the Banner would show up in  Draft ,  Parked ,  Pending ,  Exception  (if all exceptions have not been cleared), and  Coding  status. When should the Banner  go away ? Once the Invoice is in  Approved,   Posted ,  Partially Paid  or  Paid  status. If there are  multiple  line items with Accounting changes then how should the Banner behave ? Show  all  line items with accounting changes separately in the Banner. Clicking each one of them takes the user to their appropriate audit trail Summary changes. ( Open to other suggestions if above solutions would hamper the performance. ) If the Invoice went through  multiple iterations  of Accounting Changes during Exception or Coding status, then how should the Banner behave? Show only the  last  update done for all line items with the accounting changes separately in the Banner. Clicking each one of them takes to their last updated audit trail Summary changes. ( Open to other suggestions if above solutions would hamper the performance. ) How should the Banner  look  like ? Banner Description  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions )- \" Accounting Changes Detected! Click here to Review Audit Logs \" \"Accounting Update: See Audit Logs\" \"Accounting Data Revised \u2013 Click here to Review\" \"New Accounting Data - Click here for Details\" \"Explore Accounting Changes in Audit Logs\" \"Review Audit Logs for Accounting changes\" Banner Color  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions ) - A suitable option could be  Purple  or a shade of  Magenta , as it's distinct from the existing colors and often signifies changes or notifications. Teal  is distinct from the existing colors and is often associated with notifications and important updates. It can catch the user's attention without being overly intense. Banner Icon Design  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions ) - A small  yellow triangle icon with an exclamation mark  inside the banner. This icon indicates that there's an important change or action required. A small  bell icon  or a  speech bubble icon  inside the banner. These icons are commonly used to signify notifications and changes. A small  clock icon  similar to the Audit logs icon. This icon indicates that there are important changes in the Audit logs. Highlighting the line item changes in the Audit Trails  ( Here are few examples, open to other suggestions ) - Use the same  Gold Yellow border  over the Line item changes for every line item that had accounting changes.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  No. Would this change impact existing documents?  Maybe To which teams should this change be communicated to?
