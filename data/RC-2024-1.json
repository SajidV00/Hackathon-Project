Acceptance Criteria: 1.  What is the change?  The system includes the Purchasing Organization field in the CSV posting files. 2.  Which customers should this change impact?  All customers who have ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true. Note:  For those customers who process memos, ACCOUNTS_PAYABLE_WORKFLOW = true. 3.  What pages should this change impact?  None \u2013 the change impacts both invoice and memo posting files. Note:  This change does not apply to auto memos. 4.  Which users should be impacted by the change?  Users who are able to post AP documents. 5.  How should this feature work? Pre-Requisites:   Conditions in AC #2 are fulfilled. The CSV connector is enabled by the Admin. A document is in an   or   status, ready to be posted out of the system. Document Posting When a user or system posts a single/multiple documents, the system includes the Purchasing Organization in the posting file. The system showcases two fields for each document line item, as listed below. The positioning of these fields are  dynamic  based on the current implementation, that is, they can be positioned anywhere in the file (using the script). Purchasing Organization Code Purchasing Organization Description Note to QA:  Please ensure to test the dynamic positioning of the fields listed above, that is, verify if the Purchasing Organization fields can be positioned at any location in the file. The system displays the values as-is. The system leaves the fields above as empty/null if no Purchasing Organization is defined. 6.  Do we need a data fix for existing customers?  Yes. A data script will be required to position the two Purchasing Organization fields at the far right of the posting file  for existing customers who will have CSV connector on at the time of executing the script in the respective environment . The data script may need to be executed in DEVQA, SOCI, PERR, and Production environments. 7.  Would this change impact existing documents?  Yes, after the change is deployed in Production. Existing documents being posted will have Purchasing Organization in the CSV posting file but it will be blank/null. 8.  To which teams should this change be communicated to?  All teams. Questions: Question # AC # Raised By Inquiry Date Assignee Response Date 1 5 Deepak December 6, 2023 Ahmed December 6, 2023 2 5 Deepak December 6, 2023 December 6, 2023 # Question Recommendation Response Remarks 1 Is the CSV file static or dynamic? None. Dynamic, based on  's examination of the code. 2 Is any Purchasing Organization attribute different from any of the other Organization or Accounting elements? None. No. Key Decisions: # Decision Point Decision Reasoning Validation Plan 1 Where should we place the Purchasing Organization in the CSV posting files? Not applicable. The posting file is dynamic, meaning that the fields can be positioned anywhere. 2 Should we consider if the Purchasing Organization is enabled or not, or if the new feature toggle is enabled? No. Purchasing Organization will be available to be displayed in the CSV posting files irrespective of feature toggles or settings. Unnecessary complication and it will have no affect if Purchasing Organization info is present in the file. If no value is present, the value will be blank. 3 Do we need to massage or localize the values prior to displaying the file? Do we need to consider the leading zeroes setting? No. We don\u2019t currently take the leading zeroes into account for any posting mechanism. Backlog Grooming (December 6, 2023): Attendees:  Jaro, Mavin, Ahmed, Aqsa, Deepak Points of Discussion: Discussed the ticket overall.

        "description": "Business Case: The objective is to update the \"Manage Presets\" tab on the Apply to All modal to incorporate the Budgets field, ensuring it adheres to the same rules and patterns as on the main tab. This tab allows users to define and save combinations of values (using the same fields as on the main tab) with a unique name. These presets can then be used to auto-populate fields on the main tab. Specifics for the Manage Presets Tab: The Budgets field needs to be integrated following the same visibility and optional status rules as in the main Apply to All modal. Users should be able to define combinations of values including the Budgets field and other parent elements (Company Code, Purchasing Organization, Plant, Cost Center, GL Code). The system should allow these combinations to be saved with unique names. Presets should be recallable for auto-populating fields on the main tab. Acceptance Criteria: Integrate the Budgets field on the Manage Presets tab, ensuring it behaves consistently with its implementation on the main Apply to All modal. Enable users to create and save presets that include combinations of Budgets and its parent elements. Ensure each preset can be named uniquely and saved within the system. Allow these presets to be easily recalled and used to auto-populate fields on the main Apply to All modal. Verify that the implementation aligns with the visibility rules and behaviour of the Budgets field as specified for the main tab in",

        "summary": "Fix issues with the Budgets field on the new Apply to All modal",
        "description": "Business Case: The goal is to modify the behavior of the Budgets field on the Apply to All modal. This field is conditionally visible based on whether the Budgets functionality is enabled for the user's unitID. Once enabled, the Budgets field should always be visible on the Apply to All modal and be optional by default. Specific Use Cases: Changing Only the Budget : When a user selects a budget for the line items using the Apply to All modal, the system should display all active, non-deleted budgets from the user's company account. The user can search and select a budget without being required to fill other fields. The system should then evaluate if the selected budget matches the existing company and accounting info on the item. If it matches, the change is applied; if not, a warning message (as per   ) is shown. Changing Parent Elements of Budgets : If any parent element (Company Code, Purchasing Organization, Plant, Cost Center, GL Code) is altered, all these fields, including the Budget field, become mandatory. The system should then provide a list of budgets based on the combination of these parent elements. The user's specified combination is applied to all selected items without further validation, as the modal already ensures a valid combination. Acceptance Criteria: Modify the Budgets field visibility to always appear when the Budgets functionality is enabled. Ensure the Budgets field is optional by default. Implement a functionality to display all active, non-deleted budgets for selection. Enable a search feature within the budget selection list. Allow the application of a selected budget to all chosen items, with system validation against existing item data. In the case of only Budget being changed, display a warning message if the selected budget doesn't match the item's existing data, using the pattern specified in   . Ignore these original requirements.  Make Budget and its parent elements (Company Code, Purchasing Organization, Plant, Cost Center, GL Code) mandatory if any one of the parent elements is altered. When parent elements are also specified, provide a filtered list of budgets based on the combination of the parent elements specified by the user. Ensure the system applies the combination of changes to all selected items without additional validation in the case of parent element modification. The updated requirements; following the team\u2019s discussion and review of the existing Budgets implementation on 01/22/2024, are documented below.  In the case of any one of the parent elements ( which includes Company Code, Purchasing Org, Plant, Cost Center, GL Code ) of the Budget field being modified by the user, the Budget field should automatically become required on the Apply to All modal. This will ensure that the Apply to All modal will always send a combination of the parent element, and a Budget to be applied to the selected line items.  The system should evaluate the user\u2019s specified value for the parent element, against the company info + accounting info already present on the selected line items, one at a time. If the user\u2019s specified value can be used with the data already present on a given line item, the system should update that field in said line item, with the user\u2019s specified change. if it can\u2019t be used, then the system should leave the line item as it is and display a warning message using the pattern specified in   . Once the parent element has been updated, the system should then evaluate the user\u2019s specified value for the Budget field, against the data present on the line item. If it can be applied to the line item, then the system should update the Budget in the line item. Otherwise, the system should leave the Budget field blank on the line item, and show the user the standard \u201c Budget missing \u201d error message at the document level.  Additional information regarding the scope of work being covered in this ticket, as determined after discussion with QA: Purchase team will work off of the assumption, that the BE logic currently in the system; as of 01/22/2024, to fetch Budgets that can be used on a given line item, is working correctly. If there are any issues with that particular service\u2019s behavior, it will be referred to and addressed by the Budget team.  Example scenario to clarify the above statement: If the user updates the values in the GL Code and Budget fields on the Apply to All modal; say he selects  GL1  and  BudgetABC , respectively.  The system will 1st evaluate  GL1  against the given Company Code data on the selected line item.  Assuming that  GL1  can be used with the given company code, the system will update the value of the GL Code field in the line item to  GL1 .  Next, the system will use the existing Budget fetching logic to get all active budgets that can be used with the combination of Company Code, Purchasing Org, Plant, Cost Center and GL Code on the line item. If the user\u2019s specified Budget;  BudgetABC , is included in that list, the system will update the Budget field\u2019s value on the line item to  BudgetABC . Alternatively, if  BudgetABC  isn\u2019t part of that list returned by the system, then the budget field on the line item will be reset to empty, and the standard \u201c Budget missing \u201d error message will be displayed for that line item, at the document level.",

        "description": "Goal Identify all areas in PMAN + SmartOCI that might be impacted due to Third-Party Cookies Phaseout Context Google Chrome has announced plans to begin disabling third-party cookies for 1% of users starting in the first quarter of 2024. This action is intended for testing purposes, with the process gradually scaling up to 100% of users, probably starting sometime in Q3 2024. Source:    Browsers such as Firefox and Safari have already phased out third-party cookies. Microsoft Edge, which is based on the Chromium engine, has not yet announced any changes, and for now, third-party cookies are allowed by default. It is crucial to ensure that Vroozi customers are not significantly impacted by these planned changes. Therefore, we need to identify all areas that might be affected by the disabling of third-party cookies. Note Adab mentioned that it has been reported that customers have already complained about Looker not working in Firefox and Safari -   . Tasks Compile the inventory of potential issues introduced by Third-Party cookies in the following Google Sheet:    Identify all potential issues along with the customers who might be impacted Ensure that we have testing steps to reproduce the functionality Audit cookies while executing testing steps (refer to:  https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd#audit ) Test for breakage (refer to:  https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/3pcd#test ). This is to simulate the state after the phase-out. Note: If we are unable to execute the audit or the test for breakage, we should ask the client to perform the test on our behalf. If the functionality will stop working, we need to prioritize the issue based on customer usage and the complexity of the solution Inventory sheet :",

There should a red noty message stating that the file has been failed to upload or there are errors in the file. Here is the attached template file that should be used for the accounting string bulk upload. There is one optional column  DELETED  in the bulk upload file. It is a flag type(true or false). The user can use it to delete the existing record in the system through bulk upload. The user can provide  X or any letter  in the column to mark the  DELETED  flag true. The accounting string with the  DELETED  flag true should be soft-deleted and kept in the DB. The system should keep it in the DB with the  DELETED  flag true if the user marks the  DELETED  flag true for the string that has never existed in the system before.  Please open the  Instructions  of the attached sheet to understand the validations of each field(column) present in the bulk upload file. The column names(fields) should be case-insensitive. The system should support custom labels for accounting and company objects in the bulk upload file as column(field) names.",

        "description": "This ticket MUST be released along with:    This ticket will NOT have any effect on how the \u201cApply to All\u201d functionality works on the following documents: Payment Request Invoice Memo Expense Business Case: Following the updates done in   and    , a key element is missing: the ability to apply split accounting assignments to selected line items. This enhancement aims to provide users with the ability to assign accounting splits based on quantity, value, or percent using the new Apply to All modal. We also want to enabled users to define presets with split accounting from the \u201cManage Presets\u201d tab, and then use them from the \u201cChanges to be Applied\u201d tab.  Acceptance Criteria: Note: The behavior described in this ticket MUST work consistently on all line items, regardless of how they were added to the document: Manually via the \u201c Add Item \u201d function Shopping Cart Bulk Upload template UI Enhancement: A new field labeled \"Split Account Assignment\" should be added to the Accounting section of the Apply to All modal. The new field should have the following options: <blank>, \"None\", \"By Quantity\", \"By Value\", \"By Percent\", with <blank> as the default. Functionality for <Blank>: By default, the <blank> option should be selected.  Selecting this option should maintain the current UI state. Upon application, the system should NOT make any changes to the split accounting status of the selected items.  Instead, any fields which have values specified in them, should be updated across all the available accounting segments of all the selected line items.  Functionality for 'None': Selecting \"None\" should maintain the current UI state. Upon application, the system should overwrite existing split accounting segments with the new data provided, making all fields in the Accounting section required. Functionality for 'By Quantity': Selecting \"By Quantity\" should dynamically add at least two sets of accounting fields. Users should be able to add additional sets of identical fields. A required field labeled \"Quantity #1\", \"Quantity #2\", etc., should be added to each set. Upon application, the system should overwrite existing split accounting segments with the new data provided, making all fields in the Accounting section required. Functionality for 'By Value': Selecting \"By Value\" should replicate the functionality of \"By Quantity\", replacing \"Quantity #n\" with \"Value #n\" fields. Functionality for 'By Percent': Selecting \"By Percent\" should replicate the functionality of \"By Quantity\", replacing \"Quantity #n\" with \"Percent #n\" fields. Application of Changes: The system should evaluate if the user's specified changes are compatible with each pre-selected line item. Compatibility for split accounting by quantity will be determined by comparing the sum of the quantities specified by the user, across all accounting segments, to the total order quantity of the selected line item. If the two values are equal, then the change can be applied, otherwise, the item must not be updated. Compatibility for split accounting by value will be determined by comparing the sum of the values specified by the user, across all accounting segments, to the total order value of the selected line item. If the two values are equal, then the change can be applied, otherwise, the item must not be updated. Compatibility for split accounting by percent will be determined by comparing the sum of the percentages specified by the user, across all accounting segments. if this sum adds up to \u201c 100 \u201d, then the change can be applied, otherwise, the item must not be updated.  Error Notification: If any of the user\u2019s selected items were not updated, and the reason for that was related to the split accounting that the user was trying to apply. The system should display a persistent notification on the UI, informing the user about which items were not updated and providing a clear explanation of why they were not updated. This message should be displayed on screen using the pattern for document level warning messages; within the \u201c yellow \u201d panel.  If the user was trying to apply split accounting by quantity, this message should highlight the items that weren\u2019t updated using the text \u201c < 1 > # < 2 > not updated. The sum of the quantities across all the accounting segments you specified, did not match the order quantity of < 3 >. \u201c < 1 > :  If there\u2019s only one item in this list, then the system should use the word \u201c Item \u201d. But, if there are multiple items in this list, then the system should use the word \u201c Items \u201c. < 2 > :  If there\u2019s only one item in this list, then the system should only display the index number of that item and follow that with the word \u201c was \u201d.

If there are multiple items in the list, but they\u2019re not consecutive, the system should list the index numbers of all those items separated by commas, with the last item in that list being separated by an \u201c and \u201d.

We somehow have to keep this \" workaround \" functioning. Acceptance Criteria: Note: The behavior described in this ticket MUST work consistently on all line items, regardless of how they were added to the document: Manually via the \u201c*Add Item*\u201d function Shopping Cart Bulk Upload template Apply to All Functionality: There should be a \"Apply to All\" button in the application's user interface. This button should NOT be visible to any Employee user that has coding restrictions enabled in their user record.   The user can select one or more items before clicking the \"Apply to All\" button. Clicking the \"Apply to All\" button should open a modal dialog containing a dynamic form with multiple input fields. This modal should only show fields for the Org / Accounting elements that are enabled in the unitID.  By default, all input fields in the modal should be blank. All input fields in the modal should be optional for the user to fill in. The system should only allow a user to set values in these fields that are currently \u201c_not deleted_\u201d and active in the unitID.  Parent-Child Relationship: Some fields in the modal are considered parent elements, and others are considered child elements. If a user fills in a parent field, the system should restrict the user to selecting values in the child fields that are linked to the selected value in the parent field. This filtering mechanism must be driven off of the parent-child relationship of these elements in the unitID\u2019s master data If a parent field has only one possible value for a child field, that value should be automatically filled in by the system. Mandatory Child Fields: If the user fills in a parent field, the system must make it mandatory for the user to fill in all linked child fields before allowing the changes to be applied to the selected items. Validation and Notification: Note: The requirements documented below mean that either the user\u2019s entire set of specified changes will be applied to the line item, or nothing will be updated. There will not be a scenario where the user specifies changes to \u201c n \u201d child fields, but the system only updates some fraction of those \u201c n \u201d fields; as they were the only ones that would be valid with the existing parent field values on the line item. In this scenario, the entire set of specified changes will be discarded, and the user will be shown the appropriate error message. If the user is only updating child fields, the system should allow the user to apply changes. During the application of changes, the system must evaluate each selected item to determine if the user's specified change can work with the values already provided in the selected item's parent fields. If a user's specified change is incompatible with the existing parent field values, that item should remain unchanged. The system should display a persistent notification on the UI, informing the user about which items were not updated and providing a clear explanation of why they were not updated.

If a user's specified change is incompatible with the existing parent field values, that item should remain unchanged. The system should display a persistent notification on the UI, informing the user about which items were not updated and providing a clear explanation of why they were not updated. This message should be displayed on screen using the pattern for document level warning messages; within the \u201c yellow \u201d panel.  This message should highlight the items that weren\u2019t updated using the text \u201c < 1 > # < 2 > not updated. The specified change conflicts with one or more of the company info or accounting elements that are already present on < 3 >. \u201c < 1 > :  If there\u2019s only one item in this list, then the system should use the word \u201c Item \u201d. But, if there are multiple items in this list, then the system should use the word \u201c Items \u201c. < 2 > :  If there\u2019s only one item in this list, then the system should only display the index number of that item and follow that with the word \u201c was \u201d. If there are multiple consecutive items in the list, the system use the pattern  [index number of the 1st item in the list] - [index number of the last item in the list]  and follow that with the word  \u201cwere\u201c . If there are multiple items in the list, but they\u2019re not consecutive, the system should list the index numbers of all those items separated by commas, with the last item in that list being separated by an \u201c and \u201d. The end of the list should be followed by the word  \u201cwere\u201c .  < 3 > :  If there\u2019s only one item in this list, then the system should use the word \u201c this Item \u201d. But, if there are multiple items in this list, then the system should use the word \u201c these Items \u201c.",

The following information was updated on 12/21/2023 PKT: # Question Answer 1 Which fields should be shown on this modal? Only those fields should be visible on this UI, which the unitID is configured to use. 2 if an accounting object is enabled in the unitID, but configured as \u201cHidden\u201d in the line item configs, should the Admin be able to define a Buyer Group based on that accounting object?  Except for the GL Codes, the answer would be yes. As these accounting objects can be configured in each requester\u2019s user profile, even if the relevant fields are hidden on the UI at run-time.  3 Should the BuyerGroup definition apply any filtering logic when allowing an Admin to specify values in the fields?  Yes. But only if the BuyerGroup definition includes 1 or more Company Codes. If it does, then all child fields should present values filtered by the specified company codes. E.g. Each Cost Center in the list of options that the Admin can pick from, should be linked to at least 1 of the Company Codes that have been specified.  4 Should the BuyerGroup be updated on line items when a user updates the company info, or accounting info on that line item via the \u201cApply to All\u201d function?  Yes. When the company info, or accounting info on a line item is updated via the \u201cApply to All\u201d function, the system should evaluate whether the existing BuyerGroup assignment can work with the new information or not. If it can, then the existing assignment should be left as it is. If it can\u2019t, then the system should fetch a new BuyerGroup based on the new information available on the line item.  5 Related to the question above, what should happen in the case of split-accounting being applied to the line item?  If the line item has split accounting applied to it, then the system should base the BuyerGroup assignment on the 1st split segment in the line item\u2019s accounting info section.  6 What should happen if there are multiple BuyerGroups applicable to the line item?  Since the Buyer Group field is optional on the line item modal, we will leave that as it is. So \u2026  - If the BE doesn\u2019t return any Buyer Groups, leave this field empty - If the BE returns 1 Buyer Group, auto-select that value in this field - If the BE returns >1 Buyer Groups, auto-select the 1st value from that list in this field",
