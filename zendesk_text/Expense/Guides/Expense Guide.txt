Inclusion of Mileage
Mileage rate
The Mileage Rate is set by your Vroozi Purchase Administrator (Company ->Settings
->Expenses)




Selection of the ‘Mileage’ category adds additional
fields:
  •   From Address
  •   To Address
  •   Miles


Mileage Auto-calculation
The reimbursement amount is automatically
calculated based on mileage entered and the
prepopulated mileage rate.
      Note: Check ‘Round Trip’ to avoid creating 2
      separate expenses for the same trip.
