SUPPLIER DIRECTORY USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS
Additional improvements have been made to the Supplier Directory making the
experience more efficient and user-friendly. For one, user-generated reports can now be
filtered by group (groups were introduced in the March release). This release also includes:


FULL DISPLAY OF ALL FIELDS INCLUDING CUSTOM FIELDS
Users no longer need to expand the fields to display all the content in a section,
including all the custom fields added to the supplier record. The new page display also
reduces scrolling.
