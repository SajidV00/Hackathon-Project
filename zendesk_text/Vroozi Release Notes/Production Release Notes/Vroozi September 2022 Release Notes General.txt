Vroozi Purchase (Requesters, Approvers,
Buyers, and Central Receivers)

CENTRAL RECEIVER CAN INITIATE A PO CHANGE REQUEST (POCR)
A Central Receiver has the ability to use the Purchase Order Status page to search for
any Purchase Order that is made available to them via user permissions. Central
Receivers can now initiate a PO Change Request (POCR) on those Purchase Orders.



A User can be assigned the Central Receiver Role in Master Data -> Users. Access to
company codes is also defined in the user master record.




With the right permissions, users can search and access the orders in the PO Status
page.




                                                                   Release Notes 8/20/2022 2

Only financial changes to purchase orders will trigger an approval workflow based on
configuration. Non-financial changes to purchase orders eg: accounting, category, and
dates will not trigger an approval workflow.




NEW SEARCHES IN THE PO STATUS PAGE
In the PO status page, users have additional search terms. Users can search PO name
and item numbers (manufacturer part number, part number, and sku).

TYPEAHEAD SEARCH PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS IN INVOICE LINE ITEMS

   ● Users will see noticeable performance improvements in typeahead searches
      for invoice item level drop down fields. The search results will display much
      faster as users type into the drop down field.




                                                                   Release Notes 8/20/2022 4
Vroozi Intelligence for Accounts Payable
Invoice Automation (APIA) (AP Processors)

CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION IN THE INVOICE HOPPER

Vroozi Intelligence will provide contextual information in the invoice hopper so AP
Processors can possibly match open POs (eg: supplier didn’t provide the PO number on
the invoice) and view historical volumes.

See the blue bar at the top of the screen shot.




                                                                Release Notes 8/20/2022 5
PO MATCHING WITH JUST PARTIAL INFORMATION

During invoice creation and data entry, Vroozi Intelligence will match POs based on
partial information.

1. Suppliers only specify the rightmost numeric portion of the PO.

2. Suppliers miss a 0 as part of the PO #.




                                                                     Release Notes 8/20/2022 6
MORE AUTO CONSOLIDATION

Companies who have been using auto consolidation will now see more scenarios
where the invoice line items are automatically consolidated



The setting to automatically consolidate invoice items is under Admin -> AP Settings ->
Preferences -> Vroozi Intelligence.




                                                                   Release Notes 8/20/2022 7
Multiple invoice items will be presented as a single line item. Users can restore the
multiple invoice line items using “Restore Item(s)”.
