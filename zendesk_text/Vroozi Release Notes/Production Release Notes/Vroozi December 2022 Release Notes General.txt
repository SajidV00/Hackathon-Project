Vroozi Purchase (Requesters, Approvers,
Buyers, and Central Receivers)

PO CANCELLATION WHEN ORDERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED
A user will be able to cancel a PO document that has been received but not yet completely
invoiced (ie: an invoice against the PO has not been posted).

Previously, a user did not have the option to cancel a PO if it had been partially received. This was
only possible by canceling each line item after doing a PO Change Request (POCR).

A user will now see the option to Cancel Purchase Order on the PO Status and PO Detail screens.

On the PO Status screen, it will be available under the Action & Filter menu




On the PO Detail screen, the Cancel PO option will be available until an invoice is posted for at
least 1 item.




                                                                               Release Notes 11/4/2022 2
If a user cancels the PO, a confirmation message will appear:




When a PO is canceled, a Goods Return will be created automatically for the items that have been
received




                                                                          Release Notes 11/4/2022 3
If an Invoice is Posted for an Item, the Cancel Purchase Order option will not be available to the
user. If there are line items in the Purchase Order that have not been invoiced and the user wants
to cancel the purchase order, then the user will have to manually cancel each remaining line item
by doing a PO Change Request (POCR).




USER CAN NOW ADD OR UPDATE NOTES DURING PO CHANGE REQUEST
The notes section in a PO during a Change Request is now editable. Users making
changes to a PO can add or update the notes.




Vroozi Purchase (Admin)
CUSTOM LABELS CAN BE DEFINED FOR ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATION
ELEMENTS
Admins can rename the accounting and organizational elements to better describe
how they are being used by the company. Changing names can be done in the Admin
Panel under Documents (Documents => Custom Labels). The Admin can define the
custom label for:

   ●   Cost Centers
   ●   GL Accounts
   ●   Customer
   ●   Location
   ●   Location Type
   ●   Class




                                                                            Release Notes 11/4/2022 4
   ●   Company Code
   ●   Plant
   ●   Purchasing Org.




SUB-MENUS FOR DOCUMENT => SETTINGS
Lots of options to change the PO settings deserve a separate menu. Under Documents
=> Settings in the Admin Panel, there is a selection for Purchase Order settings and All
Documents.




                                                                    Release Notes 11/4/2022 5
Vroozi Intelligence for Accounts Payable
Invoice Automation (APIA) (AP Processors)

VROOZI INTELLIGENCE WILL MATCH POTENTIAL POS FOR NON PO CXML
INVOICES

In the last release, we introduced the feature for AP Processor to match open POs to
the Email based Invoices in Hopper. In this release AP Processor can now match open
POs to the cXML based Invoices.

A user can assign a PO from the action column added to the PO lookup overlay.




                                                                  Release Notes 11/4/2022 6
A Vroozi Invoice will then be created and matched to the PO selected.




VROOZI INTELLIGENCE WILL RECOGNIZE CREDIT MEMOS

Based on Vroozi Intelligence’s cognitive recognition, Vroozi will display a Create Memo
button to create a Credit Memo from an email attachment in the hopper.




                                                                    Release Notes 11/4/2022 7
