Vroozi Purchase (Administrator)
NEW PURCHASE REQUEST CONFIGURATION AND CONTROL WHEN PO
OUTPUT METHOD IS MISSING IN THE SUPPLIER MASTER RECORD

When the PO Output method is missing on the supplier master record, an
Administrator can now define controls for the PR (new) and PO (already available) to
direct the document to the right follow-on process and to create visibility for orders
that need further attention in order to send the PO to the supplier.

Administrators can define the controls from the Admin Panel at Documents =>
Settings => All Documents. Two new toggles have been introduced under the
“Purchase Requests” section under “PR Submission Configuration”.




   ●   Allow PR Submission without Supplier Output Method - Requesters will be
       able to submit Purchase Requests when the PO Output method is missing from
       the supplier master record.
          ○ For Auto PO, POs will be created in the status “Pending Output” (new
              status)
          ○ For Buy Route, POs will be created in “Draft” status for Buyers to further
              process.
   ●   Allow PR Submissions to Ad-hoc email address when Supplier Output
       Method is not given - Requesters will be able to provide an ad-hoc email
       address for the PO output when submitting the Purchase Request.
          ○ Please note: This is not applicable for companies using Buy Route. In Buy
              Route, the buyer will provide the PO output method.




                                                                      Release Notes 7/7/2023 2
Note: Specific Requesters need to be given permission in their user master data to be
able to add the ad-hoc email address




Note: Change to the Admin Panel UI for the PO configuration

Please note that the second option for the PO configuration, “Allow PO Submissions to
Ad-hoc email address”, no longer has the sub option “Allow Requesters to provide
alternate output email addresses”. That is now controlled through the new Purchase
Request configurations.




See the January 2023 Release Notes for a description of the PO Submission
configuration when the Supplier Output Method is missing.




                                                                    Release Notes 7/7/2023 3
Vroozi Purchase (Requesters, Approvers,
Buyers, and Central Receivers)

NEW PROCESSES FOR REQUESTERS TO SUBMIT PURCHASE REQUESTS
WHEN THE PO OUTPUT IS MISSING FROM THE SUPPLIER MASTER RECORD



REQUESTERS CAN SUBMIT PURCHASE REQUESTS WHEN THE PO OUTPUT IS MISSING
When “Allow PR Submission without Supplier Output Method” is enabled, Requesters
will be able to submit Purchase Requests when the PO Output method is missing from
the supplier master record for one or more of the PR lines.

When requesters submit Purchase Requests with missing PO Output, they will see an
on-screen notification that the PO Output is missing and will have a choice to submit
the PR or cancel.




   ●   When the user selects “Submit”:
         ○ For automatically generated POs (ie: Auto PO), POs will be created in the
            status “Pending Output” (new status)
         ○ For Buy Route, POs will be created in “Draft” status for Buyers to further
            process.




                                                                    Release Notes 7/7/2023 4
REQUESTERS CAN ENTER AD HOC EMAILS FOR PO OUTPUT

With “Allow PR Submissions to Ad-Hoc email address when Supplier Output Method is
not given” enabled, Requesters will be able to enter an email address in the Purchase
Request for the PO output.

When requesters submit the Purchase Request, they will see an on-screen notification
that the PO Output is missing and will be given the option to supply the email address
for the PO output.




The PO will be submitted to the supplier using the email address provided.




NEW PO STATUS “PENDING OUTPUT” TO INDICATE THE PURCHASE
ORDERS THAT NEED FURTHER ATTENTION FOR PO OUTPUT

For suppliers that do not have a PO Output method defined in the supplier master
record, the system will create POs in a new status “Pending Output”. The new status is
applied to POs automatically generated (ie: Auto PO) when the new PR configuration,
“Allow PR Submission without Supplier Output Method” is enabled and the Requester




                                                                    Release Notes 7/7/2023 5
does not input an email at the time of submitting the Request or the Requester is not
able to enter an email address per configuration.




Please note, that if you are using Buy Route, POs will be created in the “Draft” status.

The PO will be available on the Purchase Order screen




                                                                       Release Notes 7/7/2023 6
The Requester can access the Purchase Order and submit the PO to the Supplier. The
requester will see the below message after clicking Submit button on the PO




   ●   If the user clicks “Save Final PO”, the status of the PO will change to ORDERED
       but it will not be sent (ie: no output method is defined).
   ●   If the user enters an email address, “Send PO to Supplier” will be enabled and
       clicking the button will send the PO to the email address. The status of PO will
       change to ORDERED.



Vroozi Invoice (AP Processors, AP Managers)

INCLUDING DRAFTS IN THE DUPLICATE INVOICE/MEMO CHECK PLUS
REAL-TIME CHECKS

Documents under Draft status will now be taken into account to identify whether an
invoice or memo is a duplicate.

When a user tries to create an invoice with a duplicate supplier and supplier invoice
number Vroozi will indicate a potential duplicate.




                                                                      Release Notes 7/7/2023 7
Users can then view a section at the bottom of the invoice with the potential
duplicate(s).




If one of the documents is submitted, the user will not be able to submit the other
duplicate document(s).

Vroozi Invoice will also check the invoice hopper and inbox for duplicates in real time.
As documents are processed and new drafts are created in the system, Vroozi Invoice
will identify the potential duplicates in the hopper and inbox.




                                                                       Release Notes 7/7/2023 8
USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT TO NAVIGATE FROM NOTIFICATIONS TO
A COMMENT IN THE INVOICE/MEMO DOCUMENT

Users can seamlessly navigate from a comment in the Notifications Center to the
highlighted comment in the invoice or memo document.

When a user clicks the notification in the Notification Center…




                                                                  Release Notes 7/7/2023 9
the user is taken directly to the highlighted comment in the document.




AUTO-DELETE NON-PO LINE ITEMS WHEN A USER REFERENCES A PO IN
AN INVOICE

To reduce invoice processing time and to avoid confusion with duplicate PO and
non-PO line items, the system will auto-delete non-PO line items once a user
references a PO in the invoice. This is applicable for invoices that are created from
Vroozi Intelligence Cognitive Scan and Capture (ie OCR), cXML, and Supplier Portal.




                                                                     Release Notes 7/7/2023 10
Vroozi Intelligence for Accounts Payable
Invoice Automation (APIA) (AP Processors)

IMPROVEMENTS TO INVOICE-ORDER MATCHING

The algorithm to capture, parse, and match a PO from a PDF invoice has been
improved. Previously, the system did not automatically assign the PO and created
non-PO invoice lines if it did not recognize the supplier. Now Vroozi Intelligence will
assign the PO, assign the supplier from the order, and set up the PO lines in the invoice
for the AP Processor.
