Vroozi Invoice (AP Processors, AP Managers)

ADDITION OF BILLING AND SHIPPING ADDRESS TO THE INVOICE HEADER


The additional fields provide more information to the AP Processor, particularly when
processing on behalf of multiple company codes. Note: the information also enables
Vroozi Intelligence to more accurately identify the company code.




INVOICE DUPLICATE CHECK ENHANCEMENTS


This enhancement reduces the AP Processor work to quickly identify duplicate invoices.
Duplicate invoices will now be recognized and highlighted in the Hopper/Inbox itself.
The user no longer needs to create an invoice first to be informed that it is a duplicate.
Additional enhancements include:

   ●   The duplicate check is not case sensitive
   ●   Include Parked invoices
   ●   Eliminate Company Code from the duplicate check




                                                                     Release Notes 7/22/2022 2
   ●   Include the Invoice Total
   ●   Introduced new error messages when an invoice is identified as a duplicate.
       Users will see a duplicate or a potential duplicate error message.
