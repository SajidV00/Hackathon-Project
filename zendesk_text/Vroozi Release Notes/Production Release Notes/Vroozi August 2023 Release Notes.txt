Vroozi Purchase (Administrator, Requesters,
Approvers, Buyers, Central Receivers, AP
Users)
DOCUMENT FLOW SEARCH CHANGE - SELECT DOCUMENT TYPE

Document Flow will now require a user to select a document type for faster and more
precise searches. Search “All” will no longer be an option.

As soon as the user types in the “Search by document number…” field, a “Select the
document type” drop down will appear for the user to select the appropriate document
type to search.




ADMINISTRATOR ROLES WILL HAVE ACCESS TO POS IN PENDING OUTPUT
STATUS

In the previous release, we introduced a new Purchase Order (PO) status "Pending
Output". This status identified POs that required action due to missing PO output in
the supplier record. These Purchase Orders were only visible to the Requester who
generated the order from their Purchase Request. In the previous release, Requesters
would have to complete the activity in the PO to process the POs further.




                                                                Release Preview 8/11/2023 2
With this release, POs in the "Pending Output" status will now be visible to Admin users
and will be available for Admins to process the order.
