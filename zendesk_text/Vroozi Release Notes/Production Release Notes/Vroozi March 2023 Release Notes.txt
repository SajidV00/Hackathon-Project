desired Purchase Request.

READ-ONLY ACCESS TO INVOICES FOR AUTHORIZED AP PROCESSORS

Admins can now not only give edit access, but also give read-only access to AP
Processors for Invoices using the AP Settings (Admin Panel => AP Settings => Inbox).
The access settings defined under “Structured Document Submission Access Rules”
will grant AP users access to specific invoices based on company code, plant, and cost
centers. “Structured Document Submission Access Rules” apply to invoices from
integrated suppliers, such as cXML and Supplier Portal invoices.




                                                                    Release Preview 3/3/2023 4
One AP user named in the Access Rule can edit and take action on the invoice. The
other AP user(s) named in the Access Rule will be granted access to view (but not edit)
the invoice.




                                                                   Release Preview 3/3/2023 5
Resolutions
 ●   Invoice performance improvements on the PO drop down to create an invoice
     from a PO.
 ●   Improve PO identification and matching for companies using Doc Parser for
     OCR.
 ●   For companies that use the Purchase Request (PR) scheduler, the system will no
     longer submit a PR with blank lines.
 ●   SSO users can now view an Advance Ship Notice directly after clicking the View
     ASN button link in the email. Previously, this button was taking SSO users to a
     login page.
 ●   Prevent the system from showing browser autocomplete for inputs like date
     picker, currency and typeahead.
 ●   The status of a cXML PO will be updated to canceled if all items have been
     canceled by the user. Previously the status did not update appropriately.
 ●   Budget Management
        ○ The system will release the budget on line item cancellation
        ○ An assigned approver should see a Purchase Request (PR) in read-only
            mode in the case when an alternate approver approves it.
