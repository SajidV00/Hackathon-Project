  From within a document, the ‘Comment’ icon can be accessed at the top of the
  Right Action Icons. Here all users within the customer environment (and suppliers if
  using the supplier portal) can communicate with one another. When a new
  comment is added, those comments will live within the document throughout it’s
  history. Any users tagged in the communication will receive
  email notification of the comment.

     1. After selecting the conversation bubble, the
        ‘Comments’ view will expand, allowing users to ‘Add
        comment’.

     2. Comments will be viewable by all users with access
        to the document. To specifically notify a user(s), type
        @ to retrieve a list of users to tag in the comment.

            ✓ Once the comment is saved, a the
              communication will remain in the document
                             history.

                                        3. Any user(s) tagged
                                    will receive an email notification of a ‘Comment’.

                                       4. A user can also respond or take action against
                                    the document by clicking on the “Respond in Vroozi”
                                    button from the email.

                                      5. Once
         sent, all comments remain within the
         document; creating a virtual file
         cabinet for any issues, questions or
         comments that may arise.
