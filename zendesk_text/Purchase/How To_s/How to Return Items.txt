Return Items
Document a return for goods purchased through Vroozi.

FIRST STEPS
   1. Confirm the ​Receipt of Goods​ for items being returned.
   2. Reach out to the Supplier directly to communicate the return. The Vroozi Return
      process or document does not communicate back to the Supplier.

DOCUMENT RETURN

      number. In the right-most column click
      the action arrow. (shown right)

             goods. Select ‘Yes Create’. (shown right)
