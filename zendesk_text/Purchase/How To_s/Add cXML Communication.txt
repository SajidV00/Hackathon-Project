Add cXML Communication
Grab & Go covering how to add cXML document transmissions for your suppliers.


The Vroozi system can recognize and define multiple inbound and outbound cXML
transmissions from a
single supplier,
enabling the editing or
adding of supplier
communication types
in the supplier’s cXML
transmission records.

Inbound (from the
supplier)
   1. Invoice/Memo
   2. PO
      Acknowledgement
   3. PO Confirmation/Dispute
   4. Advanced Shipping Notice

Outbound (to the Supplier)
  ● POs



PART 1: ADD OR EDIT A CXML
TRANSMISSION TYPE
Click ‘View’ to edit or view credentials for the listed
supplier.

   1. Supplier: Non-editable field

   2. Document Type: Select type of document
      being edited or added.

All other required details should be obtained and
confirmed from the supplier. Sample cXML
transmissions templates may be requested by the supplier. Downloadable copies are
available from the cXML Setup view.




                                                                                1
PART 2: ENABLE TRANSMISSIONS ON THE SUPPLIER RECORD
Navigate to the ‘Basic Info’ tab in the Supplier’s record.
PO Enablement:

The ‘Output Method’ must be set to ‘cXML’.

While it is not required, we recommend entering an email address in the ‘Send PO
Alerts’ field. This ensures a supplier contact/alias receives an email notification each
time a cXML transmission is sent from
the Vroozi system.

Additional Transmissions:

   1. PO Acknowledgement

   2. PO Confirmation/Dispute

   3. Advanced Shipping Notice

   4. Invoice/Memo

Depending on the transmission type
added, select the appropriate
corresponding toggle .
For example, if you entered the transmission credentials for cXML Confirm/Dispute in
Part 1, toggle on ‘Allow cXML PO Confirmation’. By default this and all transmission
toggles will be set to Off.
