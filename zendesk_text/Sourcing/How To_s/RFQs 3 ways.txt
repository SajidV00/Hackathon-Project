RFQs 3 ways
There are ​three (​ 3)​ Requests for Quote (RFQ) Workflows based on how Requesters and
Buyers are configured.



RFQ WORKFLOW #1
Requester has permission to ‘Submit Request Forms’. Buyer brings expertise to submit
the request to Suppliers, approve bids and release back to the Requester.

 ●   Requester initiates RFQ process and assigns a Buyer. The assigned Buyer reviews the
     quote, adds additional details and submits to suppliers. Once supplier bids are
     received, the Buyer will accept a bid and send the Request draft back to the
     Requester with the accepted supplier and line item details. The Requester will then
     complete the Requisition, triggering the next phase in the procurement workflow;
     financial review if applicable or conversion to PO.

RFQ WORKFLOW #2
Requester is able to ‘Submit RFQ to Suppliers’ and will incur all responsibilities associated
with the Buyer in Workflow #1.




                                                                                            2
RFQ WORKFLOW #3
