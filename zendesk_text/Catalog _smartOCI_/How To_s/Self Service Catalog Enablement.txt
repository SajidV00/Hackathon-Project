Grab & Go covering how to enable Supplier access to update their catalogs.


From the Supplier’s record in Vroozi Catalog;
add a ‘Supplier User’.
Complete the following fields:
   1. First and Last name of the employee
      you are granting access to.
   2. Email address for employee
   3. Create the password you’d like the employee to use for their initial login.
          ● Passwords must be alphanumeric and 8 characters long.
   4. Leave box ‘Send Invitation Email’ unchecked.
          ● Instead, send the Supplier user their credentials via your company
             email. Providing both the username and password.
          ● Include the url: signin.vroozi.com
   5. Save the supplier user’s record and the Supplier record
          ● The supplier user will then receive their registration email and may
             begin making updates.



Best Practice:
Before inviting supplier users to Vroozi Catalog we encourage you to review your
internal catalog approval process.
   1. Define approvers for each catalog. All existing and new catalogs should be
      assigned approvers. Creation of Approvers would be completed in the
      Company Users field.
         → Once created, Approvers can be selected from
            a drop down menu.
         → If multiple approvers are assigned, approval is
            complete after one (1) approver has reviewed
            the changes.
   2. Review your Catalog Approval Thresholds. Found
      under Settings -> Company Settings -> Approval Workflow. Here you can
      determine what changes trigger Catalog Approvers review before they go live.
