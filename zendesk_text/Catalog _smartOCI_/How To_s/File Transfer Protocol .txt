Downloading Files from an FTP
account
The ​File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer
of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. It facilitates
the parties to transfer heavy files with much convenience and in a secured
environment.

In VROOZI, we use FileZilla Client as our FTP solution. FTP users may authenticate
themselves using a username and password scheme for granting access.

If the supplier already has their FTP account, they share the credential details with
us. Otherwise, our technical team creates a new designated account for that
particular supplier and we share the credential information with them so that they
can upload their catalogs.

The content team receives an email every time a new catalog is loaded by the
supplier on the server. The team then, logs in and extracts that catalog and uploads
it on the client’s account.




1. Download and open the FTP
   tool via F
            ​ ilezilla​.

   Right side of the account is
   the remote server site
   (external supplier) whereas,
   the left side shows the local
   site (personal system).
2. Go to the File drop-down option
   and click “Site Manager”




3. Please use the provided credentials to login to the supplier’s account.
4. Once connected, there will be two folders – production and test.

   Supplier sends the test files to the
   test folder, and the files which are
   meant to go live on production are
   given in the production folder.




5. The file will start to download
   in your system either by
   double clicking or by right
   clicking and selecting the
   “Download” option.

   The user can navigate and
   choose the desired folder
   (from the left local site) where
   he/she wants the file to be
   downloaded on his/her own
   system.
6. The file transfer status can be seen at the bottom queue of FileZilla.
