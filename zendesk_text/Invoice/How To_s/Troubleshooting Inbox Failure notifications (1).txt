order for Vroozi to accept it.

   1. The document(s) must be one of the following formats: pdf, docx, doc,
      xlsx, xls, jpeg, jpg, tif , tiff, png, or bmp

          ○   Contact the document sender (supplier) and confirm that the
              requirements must be met. Ask them to resend an updated copy that
              meets the requirements.

   2. The Document must be 25 MB or less.

          ○   Reach out to the Supplier to confirm document size must be 25 MB or
              less. Ask them to follow these requirements and resend.
                      OR
          ○   Split the document into smaller groups of sub documents yourself. (if
              accessible)

   3. Transactional documents must be attached as standard attachments.

          ○   Suppliers must send documents as readable, downloadable
              attachments. The Inbox does not support transactional documents
              shared as hyperlinks to a repository such as ​Google Drive​, ​OneDrive​ etc.

Please contact Vroozi Support if the recommended course of action does not yield a
positive outcome or if you have any questions.
