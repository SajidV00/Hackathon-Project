# Vroozi Purchase (Administrator)
## CREATE/UPDATE ACCOUNTING STRINGS IN THE ADMIN PANEL
In the December 2023 Release, Vroozi launched Accounting Validation to significantly
improve accounting accuracy on purchasing and invoice documents by adhering to
defined valid accounting strings. In this release, Administrators can define the
accounting strings in the Admin Panel User Interface (UI). Administrators will be able
to create, read, update, and delete the accounting strings.
Please note that the option to change accounting strings will need to be enabled by
the Vroozi support team. Otherwise, the accounting strings will need to be created,
updated, or deleted via APIs. Please contact our support team to enable this feature.
When enabled, Administrators will have the option to Activate, Deactivate, or Create a
new accounting string in the Accounting Validation screen.

### Create a New Accounting String
When creating a valid accounting string, administrators will provide the company and
accounting information to define the valid string with a validity period.

# Vroozi Invoice (AP Processor, AP Approvers,AP Coders and AP Managers)
## ACCOUNTING CHANGES ARE HIGHLIGHTED AFTER EXCEPTION HANDLING OR CODING.
If a user changes a documents accounting in the Exception or Coding processes,
Vroozi will highlight the changes to the AP Processor after the document is submitted
to AP. Vroozi will now show an informational message that accounting changes were
performed and highlight the changes. This will give AP the opportunity to review the
accounting prior to approval/posting.

# ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS FOR BUYER GROUPS
Additional parameters can now be used to define a Buyer Group.
- Company Codes
- Cost Centers
- GL Codes
- Projects
- Locations
Buyer Groups define how Purchase Request line items in BuyRoute and Purchase
Orders are assigned to Buyers. Prior to this release, Buyer Groups could only be defined
based on supplier and category. New additional accounting and organizational
parameters enable companies to distribute work items and orders to specific buyers to
improve sourcing and PO maintenance process efficiency.
Buyer Groups are defined in the Admin Panel under Master Data => Buyer Data =>
Buyer Groups

# Vroozi Purchase (Requesters, Buyers, and Central Receivers)
## ENHANCED APPLY TO ALL (VROOZI PURCHASE)
Users will be able to change a single field in Apply to All. Prior to this release, users
were always required to enter data in multiple fields during Apply All to maintain valid
parent-child accounting relationships eg: GLs assigned to a Company Code.
The Apply to All feature has been enhanced for the following Vroozi Purchase
documents:
- Purchase Request
- Change Request
- Purchase Order
- POCR

Now, when a user changes a field, Vroozi will evaluate if the change is valid. For
instance, if a user changes the GL account for multiple lines using Apply All, the system
will evaluate the proposed change against Company Code (parent object) for each
selected line item. If the GL is valid for that Company Code, then the system will
change the line item. If the GL is not assigned to the Company Code, the system will
not modify the line item and display a message that the proposed change could not be
applied.
Similarly, if a user changes a parent object during Apply to All (eg: Company Code), we
know that the change will impact child objects, such as GL Code, Cost Center, Project,
etc. In that case, the system will prompt the user to provide values for affected child
objects during Apply to All.

# Vroozi Invoice (AP Processor, AP Approvers, AP Coders and AP Managers)
## PURCHASING ORGANIZATION NOW AVAILABLE ON INVOICES AND MEMOS
When configured, the system will display Purchasing Organization on Invoices and
Memos at the line item level under General Information.
**[Image here]**
With this enhancement, the Purchasing Organization code can now be transmitted
from Vroozi to the companys external ERP system for both Invoices and Memos.
Customers will need to contact Vroozi Support to activate this feature. Once this
feature is enabled, Administrators can change the settings in the Admin panel. Under
Documents => Settings => All Documents => Line item Field Configuration => Company
Information, Admins can choose the appropriate Purchasing Organization field setting:
Required, Optional, or Hidden.

# Vroozi Purchase (Administrator)
## ACCOUNTING STRING BULK UPLOAD
Administrators will be able to upload accounting strings for Accounting Validation in
the Admin Panel using files in XLSX or CSV formats. Like other Vroozi master data
uploads, Administrators can download a template or export the existing data as a
starting point to build/maintain an upload file. If there are any validation errors in the
upload, an error report will be available for the Administrator to download.
Note: For data exports, when the accounting string records exceed 1 million, the system
will automatically switch to CSV format, as XLSX cannot accommodate over 1 million
records.
**[Image here]**
Please contact support if you want the accounting string feature to be enabled.

## MAKE ACCOUNTING STRINGS ACTIVE OR INACTIVE IN THE ACCOUNTING VALIDATION CONFIGURATION
A new field Status is available when creating or editing an accounting string to
designate a string as active or inactive for Accounting Validation. This will enable
Admins to quickly adjust the validation as accounting strings become active/inactive.
**[Image here]**
## AUTO INVOICE DATE CALCULATION TOGGLE IN THE SUPPLIER RECORDS
For companies where the delivery date determines the invoice start date,
Administrators have the ability to enable the Auto Invoice Date Calculation setting
within the Supplier record.   With the feature enabled, the delivery date specified
during Goods Receipt (GR) creation will automatically populate as the Invoice Date on
the suppliers invoices.
**[Image here]**
Note: Please contact the Vroozi support team to enable this toggle. This toggle setting
will be saved and tracked on the Supplier change history page in future releases.

## TOGGLE FOR ADMINS TO CONFIGURE INVOICE CODING AND APPLY ALL DURING INVOICE EXCEPTION HANDLING
This release introduces a new toggle in Invoice Coding Access, to allow Admins to
enable or disable Coding and ""Apply to All"" functionality for Employee, Buyers, and AP
Coders, during Exception Handling. Previously, these features required contacting
Vroozi Support for activation. With this update, Admins have direct control over these
settings.
This is available on Accounts Payable => Settings => Preferences screen

# Vroozi Purchase (Budget Approver)
## ACCOUNTING VALIDATION IN BUDGET WORKFLOW
The Accounting Validation process will now be triggered when the budget approver
approves a Purchase Request (PR). This will be applicable when both budget workflow
and accounting validation features are enabled.
**[Image here]**
# Resolutions
- Improved processing time for large catalog files containing more than 900,000
       items.
- Payment Terms in the Purchase Order header now appear in ascending order.
- Fixed an issue where the system populated the incorrect cost center when using
    the Purchase Request line item bulk upload functionality.
- The system will now trigger accounting validation when an invoice, in Pending
    status, is loaded or refreshed.
- When a user created a Goods Receipt (GR) for an invoice with GR exception, the
    invoice was not routing to the right user/group for accounting validation errors.
- The system now accurately detects and routes the invoice to the correct
    user/group to resolve the accounting validation error.
- Tax Calculations will now be automatically updated in the invoice when a user
    modifies the item quantity or unit price via inline editing.
- Previously, draft invoices generated from cXML could not be updated after
    canceling the corresponding purchase orders. Users experienced a persistent
    ""required fields"" error. Now, the draft invoices can be updated and saved
    correctly for canceled POs."

# Vroozi Admin (Administrator)
## EXPANDED APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR THE NEW DYNAMIC WORKFLOW
Companies can configure more flexible approval rules for Purchase Requests, Purchase
Order Change Requests, Invoices, Memos, and Payment Requests (new) with Vroozis
new Dynamic Workflow. When creating conditions that trigger workflows, company
Admins can create more granular conditions by adding more organizational and
accounting objects that are not seen as Duplicate Approval Rule. Previously, admins
faced restrictions when creating approval rules that belonged to the same accounting
family (eg: approval for a cost center, and approval for the same cost center plus GL).
Admins can create multiple conditions, but if the system identifies multiple approval
rules that apply to a document, it will default to the Fallback AP Approver for approval.

**[Image here]**

Note: This applies to customers using Vroozis Dynamic Workflow. Customers who do
not have the Dynamic Workflow feature enabled will need to contact the Support Team
to activate it.

## NEW DYNAMIC WORKFLOW FOR PAYMENT REQUESTS
Customers using Payment Requests and the Dynamic Workflow will see the option to
select Payment Requests when configuring the workflow rules.
**[Image here]**
To enable the Dynamic Workflow for Payment Requests, contact Vroozi Support or
Customer Success.

## AUTO INVOICE DATE CALCULATION BASED ON RECEIPTS - SUPPLIER BULK UPLOAD CONFIGURATION AND TRACK CHANGES IN THE SUPPLIER HISTORY

Master Record to enable Auto Invoice Date Calculation. With this enabled for a

supplier, the Invoice date is calculated based on the Receipt date for that supplier. In
this release, Vroozi enabled 2 new capabilities: the ability to configure the Auto Invoice
Date Calculation using the supplier bulk upload file and the ability to track Auto Invoice
Date Calculation changes in the supplier history.
Note: Please contact the Vroozi Support team to enable Auto Invoice Date Calculation.

### CONFIGURING AUTO INVOICE DATE CALCULATION USING   THE     SUPPLIER BULK UPLOAD
Auto Invoice Date Calculation can now be activated for a supplier in the supplier bulk
upload file. The column heading in the bulk upload file is:
- AUTO_INVOICE_DATE_CALCULATION

### TRACK AUTO INVOICE DATE CALCULATION CHANGES IN THE SUPPLIER HISTORY
Vroozi now tracks changes made to the Allow Auto Invoice Date Calculation
configuration in the supplier master data record under Change History.

# Vroozi Invoice (AP Processor, AP Approvers, AP Coders, and AP Managers)
## CONNECT TO A HIGHLIGHTED MESSAGE FROM AN EMAIL NOTIFICATION
When users navigate from an email notification to a message in the Vroozi Invoice, the
relevant message is now highlighted in the invoice side panel. Users can now easily find
the specific comment in which they were tagged.

**[Image here]**

# Vroozi APIs
## CATALOG API TO CREATE OR UPDATE CATALOGS
We are excited to announce catalog management capabilities through the Vroozi
Platform open APIs.
The new catalog APIs will allow companies, especially API-capable suppliers, to directly
create a new catalog or update an existing catalog. The APIs will create a Working
catalog that then can be reviewed, approved, and published by the Catalog
Administrator and Catalog Approvers using Vroozis Catalog Content Management
process.
For further details please view the API documentation available at: Vroozi Catalog API

# Resolutions
- Vroozi is reducing the number of non-invoice files (eg: logos) that appear in the
       invoice hopper by filtering gif files.
- Vroozi improved the precision when rounding the calculated tax value to the
       hundredths decimal in the Purchase Request and Purchase Order.
- Users are no longer able to specify a negative value in the unit price field for line
       items in the PR and PO.
- The system now updates the line item tax when a user copies an existing PR and
       then manually edits the line items.
- PO document history would show the unit price for newly copied line items
       added in a POCR as 0 even though the unit price was not zero.
- When copying a Purchase Request, the system will now enforce inactive Buyer
       Groups.
- In a Purchase Request bulk upload, the system will assign the correct cost
       centers (ie: cost center id) for a company code where there are cost centers
       assigned to multiple company codes.
- Suppliers who could not see the entire item description in a RFQ bid can now
       use ellipsis to view the complete item description.
- Addressed degrading performance with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 file
       storage service when submitting a document containing an attachment."

# Vroozi Purchase (Administrator)
## NEW DYNAMIC WORKFLOW TRIGGER BASED ON HIGHEST VALUE
Administrators have a new option to trigger the dynamic workflow approvals based on
the accounting combination with the highest total spend value across all the line
items. This means that approver(s) responsible for the highest spend in a Purchase
Requests, Purchase Order Change Requests, Payment Requests, Memos, and Invoices
will make the approval decision for that document.
The new option to trigger the approval is available in the Admin Panel under Company
=> Workflow => Approval Matching Method. Admins will have the option to select the
new approval trigger based on the accounting combination with the highest value, or
based on the first line item (default).
**[Image here]**
Note: Customers will need to have the New Dynamic Workflow enabled in their Vroozi
system. The new Dynamic Workflow provides greater flexibility and control in the
approval process to adapt the approvals to better suit specific financial oversight
requirements (eg: based on combinations of organizational and accounting elements).
The new Dynamic Workflow delivers more of the financial approvals that reduce
financial risks and improve compliance with internal controls.
**[Image here]**
## MORE ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL ELEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE DYNAMIC WORKFLOW CONDITIONS
The Dynamic Workflow introduces additional accounting and organizational elements
to expand the approval workflow coverage and control more spend categories under
management. The new accounting and organizational elements include:

- WBS Elements
- Internal Orders
- Profit Centers
- Classes
- Customers
- Purchasing Organizations
- Location Types

The additional elements allow for more precise and relevant workflow configurations
that better align with the specific financial controls and organizational structures of the
organization.
The configuration is available in the Admin Panel under Company => Workflow =>
Approval Rules. The accounting and organizational objects are selected in the workflow
condition(s) to trigger the rule.

Note: Customers will need to have the New Dynamic Workflow enabled in their Vroozi

financial risks and improve compliance with internal controls.
**[Image here]**
## BULK UPLOAD/DOWNLOAD TO CREATE AND MAINTAIN THE DYNAMIC WORKFLOW APPROVAL RULES
Admins will have the ability to manage the Dynamic Workflow approval rules more
efficiently through a bulk upload and download using a file in .XLSX file format.
The bulk upload/download is available in the Approval Rules configuration in the Admin
Panel under Company => Workflow => Approval Rules. A downloadable template is
provided in the system to set up the correct format for the upload. Also, an error report
can be downloaded to quickly correct any issues with the latest upload.

# Vroozi Purchase & Invoice (Employee, Buyer, Approver, AP Processor, AP Approvers, AP Coders and AP Managers)
## INTRODUCING DRAG-AND-DROP COLUMNS
This release introduces drag-and-drop functionality to the user experience. Users will

# Resolutions
- When Purchase Requests were submitted and sent to external systems (eg: and
     ERP system), the email notifications to Requesters indicated that the PR was
     approved. The email notification will now more accurately state that the PR has
     been submitted to the External System for further processing.
- This release resolves an issue where the Apply to All modal would not close after
     selecting the Tax Code field in the Invoice and Memo.
    .msg files are no longer supported for upload to an invoice document. The file
     type causes errors when posting the Invoice to NetSuite."

# Vroozi Administration (Admin)
## Admin Control for Out of Office Settings
Admins now have the ability to control and manage the Out of Office (OOO) settings for users in the Admin Panel under Master Data > Users.  
To keep approvals moving when users forget to set up their own Out of Office configuration, the Out of Office settings can now be configured by the company’s Admin user.

The user record now shows two tabs: “BASIC INFO” and “DELEGATION INFO”.

- “BASIC INFO” contains all the existing user settings, such as Basic Information, Roles, Approval Settings, Document Defaults, etc.
- “DELEGATION INFO” (new) contains the Out of Office (OOO) settings that allow Admins to efficiently manage OOO configurations based on the company's policies and user roles.  

**[Image here]**


- In the configuration, the Admin can:

    - Define the validity period 
    - Create a message 
    - Set the Action and an Out of Office approver where applicable 
      - Next Approver - skips the person’s approval step and goes to the next step 
      - Specific Approver - select from an approver role in the system 
      - Do Not Forward

**[Image here]**

The availability of the Delegation Tab is conditional upon the company's OOO settings and the user’s role.

**[Image here]**

With Out of Office configuration on the user record, Admins now have greater control over OOO settings, especially for roles critical
to keep approval workflows moving, including Financial Approvers, Payment Request Approvers, Sourcing Approvers, and Accounts Payable Approvers.

## Assign Alternative Approvers and Buyers in the User Profile
Company Admins now have the ability to assign Alternate Approvers and Buyers  in the Admin Panel under Master Data > Users.  
On the Basic Info tab, the Alternative Approver is located in the Approval Settings and the Alternative Buyer is located under the Buyer Settings.  

## VROOZI BUDGETS CAN BE DEFINED AGAINST ANY ACCOUNTING/ORGANIZATION OBJECT
Vroozi expanded Budget Management to include all the Organizational and
Accounting Objects. Companies now have greater control to ensure budgets are
enforced for all spend under management.

For the Alternate Approve, both approvers (approver and alternate) will get a notification to approve a document.  Either approver can take action on that document.  
Similarly for the Alternate Buyer, the buyer and alternate will have the option to take action on the work item.

Now Admins can assign alternate users to enhance the management of approval and purchasing workflows for faster and more flexible workflows.

## Type Ahead Search to Assign Approvers
to assign an approver (eg: alternate, out of office, next approver) Vroozi introduces a user-friendly search field to quickly find and select an approver.
Instead of scrolling through dropdowns, Admins can now use type ahead search to assign a person.

## Accounting Validation Enhancements

With Accounting Validation enabled, companies can make sure that valid accounting combinations are used in the purchasing documents.  In this release, the Vroozi team delivered new features to enhance the validation and user experience. 
Please note that Accounting Validation needs to be enabled for your account.

### Accounting Validation Display on the Line Item View
The line item view now displays the results of the accounting validation so that users can take the specific actions to resolve the error(s). 
As the user is working in the line item view, the system will inform users immediately regarding any invalid accounting strings.  
**[Image here]**

### Provide missing Output Destination when the Accounting Validation is Successful
When the Output destination is missing from the Supplier record and the system needs to prompt the user for the next step, the system will only prompt the user when the accounting validation is successful.  

### Add Approval Notes after the Accounting Validation is Successful
Vroozi will run the accounting validation upon the approval of the Purchase Request and will only ask the approver to add approval notes if the accounting validation is successful. In case of an invalid accounting string, 
the system will only display the error for the accounting validation error and will not show the Add Approval Notes prompt.

# Resolutions
- Resolved an issue where the catalog item details page would get stuck loading due to a missing supplier logo.
- The system now properly searches documents based on Company Code.
- Drag-and-drop file attachment functionality now works as expected, allowing users to attach files seamlessly.
- The PO closing notification email has been re-translated into Japanese.
- When invoices with 0 tax are created from PR/POs using OCR, the tax value on the invoice accurately reflects zero tax.
- Tax amounts will now recalculate upon adding or updating tax codes in Apply to All.
- For partial invoices, we adjusted the tolerance percentage calculation method to consider the entire invoiced quantity rather than just the remaining amount.
- cXML, Supplier Portal, and Hopper invoices will only be displayed to relevant users in the Document Flow.
- The system will no longer revert to a limited line item view after updating an invoice line item .  The system will continue to ""Show all"" if that’s where the user started.
- ""Apply to All"" on non-PO Invoices will no longer trigger an error when there’s a missing company code.
- AP users can search for invoice line items regardless of letter case.
- OCR icons will now be displayed correctly for all relevant fields ie: where the system entered data.
- Requesters with Admin roles will only see  Accept/Reject after exception resolution  on  system-generated invoices (e.g., cXML or OCR) based on structured document rules matches, or defaults to the AP Processor/Manager group if no matches are found.
- The system will now release the budget amount upon PO cancellation.
- The supplier acknowledgment button will now be visible in the POCR Confirmation email in all cases where this has been enabled for a supplier.
- We fixed how categories are sorted on the PR/PO line item view. The list of categories will now follow the same sorting order as Category Management in the Admin panel.
- We did a re-translation in Japanese for the labels used on the Save & Confirm action buttons during Goods Receipt (GR) creation.
- Customers with a company code restriction in their user profile will now be able to use  the PR bulk upload without errors."

# Vroozi Administration (Admin)
## LINE ITEM FIELD CONFIGURATION FOR AP DOCUMENTS
When Admins define fields such as Location, Customer, Class, Project as Required,
Optional, or Hidden, the settings now apply to AP documents. This delivers more
consistency to what line item information is captured and managed, and reduces the
manual adjustments and potential inconsistencies between documents.

Currently this applies to Location, Customer, Class and Project Line Item Field
Configuration settings. Other accounting fields such as Cost Center, WBS Element,
Internal Order, Profit Center, Plant, and GL Account will be supported in a future
release.

To enable this feature, please submit a Help Ticket to Vroozi Support to request this
feature.
**[Image here]**
## MULTIPLE PURCHASE ORDER TERMS & CONDITIONS
Customers now have the ability to maintain multiple Purchase Order Terms and
Conditions, which can be applied based on company or supplier.

Administrators can configure Vroozi to assign Terms and Conditions based on Supplier
or Company Code, or Buyers can select the Terms and Conditions for a specific

Purchase Order (PO). Users will be able to create, manage or update the Terms and
Conditions on a draft PO prior to submission, or via a Purchase Order Change Request
(POCR). All changes and updates made to the Terms and Conditions in the Purchase
Order will be recorded in the PO Change History.

This feature will be automatically enabled for all Vroozi customers. To manage, update,
or change this feature navigate to Admin Panel -> Documents -> Settings -> Purchase
Orders

## VROOZI BUDGETS CAN BE DEFINED AGAINST ANY ACCOUNTING/ORGANIZATION OBJECT
Vroozi expanded Budget Management to include all the Organizational and
Accounting Objects. Companies now have greater control to ensure budgets are
enforced for all spend under management.

Companies that have Budget Management activated can add and edit budgets under
Admin Panel => Master Data => Budgets.

**[Image here]**

In the Budget, the Admin or Budget Owner can add or edit the accounting string to
include the accounting and organizational objects that can access the budget.

**[Image here]**

If your company is not using Budget Management today, please contact Customer
Support (eg: support ticket) or Customer Success (success@vroozi.com).

## VROOZI BUDGET MANAGEMENT BULK UPLOAD
As an alternative to the Budget APIs, customers using Vroozi Budget Management can
now upload budgets through a file upload/download process based on an upload
template.

**[Image here]**
                                                                Release Notes 09/13/24 4
Under Admin => Master Data => Budgets the Admin roles can download the template,
download the current budget configuration, or upload a file.

The Budget Bulk Upload template contains a sheet for the fields that define the
budget as well as an Instructions sheet for how to enter the budget data into the fields.
If your company is not using Budget Management today, please contact Customer
Support (eg: support ticket) or Customer Success (success@vroozi.com).

# Vroozi Invoice (AP Processor, AP Coder, AP Manager)
## ENHANCED APPLY TO ALL IN THE VROOZI INVOICE
All the recent enhancements to Apply to All in Vroozi Purchase are now available in
Vroozi Invoice, which means Apply to All has a consistent experience across the Vroozi
Procure-to-Pay documents.
When using the Apply to All functionality, Vroozi now evaluates the users proposed
changes in the Vroozi Invoice for data consistency (e.g. the change is valid for that
company code) for the selected line items. If the changes are valid, the changes will be
applied to all the selected line items. By contrast, if the proposed data changes are not
valid, the line items will remain unmodified and the user will receive a message on the
document UI. In the case where a user modifies a single field in which other fields are
dependent, the corresponding child fields will be displayed for the user to fill out within
the Apply to All module upon validation.

                                                                     Release Notes 09/13/24 5
This feature will be automatically enabled in all customers.
**[Image here]**
## CUSTOMIZABLE INVOICE AND MEMO LINE ITEM COLUMN DISPLAY
Users are now able to personalize the line item columns displayed on the Vroozi Invoice
and Memo documents. Users will now be able to see pertinent data based on their
specific needs at a glance to ensure accuracy and to streamline the process of
managing and reviewing line item details.
The column setting is available under a gear icon on the right side of the line field
label area.
**[Image here]**
                                                                  Release Notes 09/13/24 6
In the Column preferences, users can select and deselect the fields that are displayed
at a glance in the Vroozi Invoice.
**[Image here]**

# Vroozi Purchase (Buyers)
## SELECT OR CHANGE THE PURCHASE ORDER TERMS & CONDITIONS
Customers now have the ability to maintain multiple Purchase Order Terms and
Conditions. Buyers can select the Terms and Conditions for a specific Purchase Order
(PO). In addition, Buyers will be able to create, manage or update the Terms and
Conditions on a draft PO prior to submission, or via a Purchase Order Change Request
(POCR). All changes and updates made to the Terms and Conditions in the Purchase
Order will be recorded in the PO Change History.

# Resolutions
- Updated Japanese translation for PO Close notification email.
- Also, under translation, user group names will now be translated and displayed
     accurately within Vroozi.
- Resolved an issue where the Location field was not updating correctly on the
     Invoice document when using ""Apply to All"".
- Invoices created and processed at the exact same time would create duplicate
     Invoice numbers, which would cause errors when posting the invoices to
     external systems. The system will no longer create duplicate invoice numbers.
- This release fixes an issue in the Apply to All feature where Quantity, Value, and
     Amount fields in the ""Changes to be Applied"" tab were not populated with
     preset values.
- Resolves an issue where users were able to approve their own PRs if they were
     part of the defined approval chain in the new dynamic workflow. Now, if the
     requester or the person that owns the PO in the case of a POCR is part of the
     approval chain, the system will automatically skip that individual, and move onto
     the next approver in the chain.
- Updated the email Buyers receive for POs or PO Change Requests (POCR) for
     visibility into the type of document they are receiving."

## LINE ITEM FIELD CONFIGURATION FOR AP DOCUMENTS (MORE FIELDS)
Admins can set fields such as Cost Center, WBS, Internal Order, Profit Center, GL Account
and Plant as optional, required, or hidden for Invoices and Memos. The settings now apply
to AP documents line items to ensure fields are handled consistently across all
Procure-to-Pay documents.
To enable this feature, please contact support@vroozi.zendesk.com. Once enabled, line
item fields in AP documents will adhere to the configured settings.
**[Image here]**


## OPTION TO RESTRICT INVOICE INBOX VISIBILITY FOR AP MANAGERS
If enabled, AP Managers will only see AP documents in the Hopper Inbox (Document
Inbox) or Archive folder based on the Email Access or Structured Document Submission
Access Rules. AP Managers will need to be explicitly assigned using the access rules to
access AP documents in the inbox. Some companies allow AP Managers to access all
documents, but if you want to restrict what the AP Managers can access, then this option
will allow the restriction through the access rules.

To enable this feature, please contact support@vroozi.zendesk.com. Once activated, AP
Managers will see only the documents associated with their assigned Access Rules.

The Access Rules can be defined in the Admin Panel under Accounts Payable => Settings
=> Inbox under the sections Email Access Rules and Structured Document Submission
Access Rules.
**[Image here]**

# Vroozi Purchase (Supplier)
## MORE PROMINENT PO CANCELLATION STATUS ON THE PO PDF
The canceled status will now be more prominent on a Purchase Order (PO) PDF so that
suppliers clearly know that the order is canceled ie: not a new order.
The PO pdf is generated and sent to the supplier after a user performs a Purchase Order
Change Request (POCR). When items are canceled in an order, suppliers will now have
better visibility into the status of the PO or PO Line items.
**[Image here]**
# Resolutions
- In Vroozi Purchase and Marketplace, users can now add fractional quantities to the
     shopping cart from Punchout Catalogs items.
- If an item has an Item Model Number defined, the field will now be displayed in the
     Purchase Request and Shopping Cart item details.
- Users can now customize the line item column display in the Payment Request.
- Vroozi Purchase
  
    - Removed the GL display restriction (formerly 10 GLs) in the User Profile GL
               Access field.
    - Fixed searching in the Receipts => Ready to Receive screen. Prior to this
               release, when the system would reset the documents list to the default state,
               it didnt recognize the user's new search query until the reset was complete.
               Now the user can't enter a new value in the search field until the reset
               operation on the screen is complete.
    - PR and PO Line items will no longer be deleted after updating the supplier
               master data.
    - Resubmitting a Rejected Change Request after changing item data will
               update the line item status to 'Change(s)' instead of 'New Addition'.
    - Resolved a freezing issue in ""Apply to All"" caused by manually adding a %
               sign in the Split by Percent value. The % value now defaults automatically,
               eliminating the need for manual entry.
- Catalog change report will capture additional fields after a user updates the item
       price via Direct Item Update.
- Fixed an issue where the configurable item checkbox functionality did not work
       properly if existing items are updated via Merge & Update.
- Vroozi Invoice

    - Improved Inbox, Invoice, and Track Invoice user experience on mobile.
    - Users can now successfully select and replace an existing exception
               percentage.
- Resolved an issue in the line item column selection (Invoice, Memo, and Purchase
       Request) where the filtering options did not highlight relevant matches and caused
       the Column Preferences list to reset upon selection."

# Vroozi Administration (Admin)
## COMPANY CODE RESTRICTIONS FOR AP MANAGERS
Administrators can restrict an Accounts Payable Managers visibility to Invoices and Memos
by Company Code. This allows companies to create invoice processing strategies across
multiple company codes and restrict invoices that need to be processed by the relevant
company code.

To enable this feature, please contact support@vroozi.zendesk.com. When enabled,
Admins configure the restriction under Accounts Payable > Settings >Inbox > Structured
Document Submission Access Rules.

This feature is related to the Restricting Inbox Visibility for AP Managers feature that was
released in October 2024, where companies could restrict AP Managers to specific invoices
defined in the inbox access rules (as opposed to AP Managers seeing all invoices).

Currently this feature is rolled out to AP Managers. In future releases, we plan to include AP
Approvers, AP Coders, and AP Auditor roles.
**[Image here]**
# Vroozi Purchase (Supplier)
## HIGHLIGHTING CANCELED LINE ITEMS IN AN UPDATED PO PDF
Canceled line items on a Purchase Order Change Request will now be displayed more
prominently on the PDF document that is sent to the supplier. This will provide better
visibility into what line items were canceled on the new PO version.
This feature will be available by default on all POCR documents that are sent to the supplier.
**[Image here]**
# Resolutions
-PRs that were auto-forwarded during Approval incorrectly display the Fallback
       Approver as part of the approval chain. The Fallback Approver will no longer
       display when a PR is auto-forwarded.
- The system will now account for deleted unreceived items in a PO Change
       Request (POCR) to update the PO status to RECEIVED.
- Notes will no longer be duplicated for rejected POCRs where the user updated
       the Supplier Notes.
- Users will be able to delete items on a rejected PO Change Request so they can
    update and resubmit.
- Users will be able to access the side panel on a mobile device when in landscape
    mode.
- The PO Search filter will now include POs created via Buy Route.
- When an admin eliminates roles in user profile, the change will be reflected in
    the user bulk upload.
- Resolved an inconsistency in quantity displayed. An internal catalog would
    appear as, 1, but when transferred to the cart the system would display 1.0.
- Eliminated the duplicate attachment when a Sourcing Reviewer uploaded an
    attachment on a POCR.
- Track All Invoices sort by feature would display the correct results in the table.
    However when a user entered the document view and navigated to the next
    invoice using the arrow buttons, the search results and sorting was not
    maintained. The next invoice in the document view will now follow the sort
    display.
- Resolved an issue where the GL Account was not displayed on the Invoice PDF.
   Users can now view, create, and process invoices from the hopper without losing
    their place in their work list eg: not be disrupted by new incoming invoices.
- Clients using the line-item configuration settings for AP documents, along with
    the Customer field, should see the document settings (Required, Optional, or
    Hidden) applied when valid accounting objects are used in the invoice line item
    that are associated with one or more valid customers in the system.
- Fixed the issue where AP users with both AP Manager and AP Processor roles
    were unable to see invoices in the Hopper.
   Resolved the issue where AP Processors could view and take action on Supplier
    Portal invoices from the Hopper that did not follow the Structured access rule.
- Clients who were not using any accounting categories received a ""Cost Center
    required"" error message on Non-PO OCR Invoice documents. This issue has
    been corrected.
- For non-catalog items without a Unit of Measure (UOM), the system assigns AU
    if that exists in the company's UOM master data. Otherwise, UOM is left blank.
    For catalog items, the UOM is taken from the catalog UOM.
- Users can now update the delivery date or service period on line items during PO
    Change Requests."

# Vroozi Analytics
## INVOICE EXCEPTION TRACKING IN REPORTING
Invoice exception types will now be stored in the analytics database. The system will
now capture the exceptions as the invoice transitions through various statuses and
eventual resolution. Users with reporting access will gain insights into why invoices go
into exception handling and how the exceptions are eventually resolved. Ultimately the
analysis will help to reduce exceptions or to resolve exceptions faster over time.
This feature will be available by default and accessible by companies with Ad Hoc
reporting. The Vroozi team will deliver standard exception reports for all customers in
an upcoming release. Note that the exception types will be available on any newly
created documents (ie: it will not be available for historical invoices created prior to this
release).

# Vroozi Invoice
## APPROVAL PREVIEW AND TRACING IN INVOICES, MEMOS, AND PAYMENT REQUESTS
For companies using the new dynamic workflow, Invoices, Memos, and Payment
Requests will now display an approval preview in the right-hand document menu.
Users in the AP documents can now confirm that the document will follow the proper
workflow.

In addition, for invoice approvals that are in process, have completed, or have restarted
due to rejection, the approval chain view shows the approval status and history,
including approvers who have stepped into the process due to fallback approval, out of
office, delegate approver, or AP Manager approval. Also, if workflow is changed and a
new approval chain is created, Vroozi will display the previous chain information under
Previous Approval Chain with a version number. The new Approval Preview and
Tracing enables more complete invoice approval tracing to show what changed, and
who approved.

This feature will be enabled automatically for all customers who have the Dynamic
Workflow enabled. To enable the dynamic workflow, please contact Customer Support
or email Customer Success at success@vroozi.com

# Resolutions
- For companies who have not created structured document access rules for
     invoices, the system will now assign auto-created invoices to AP Managers and
     AP Processors using the correct default group.

- For companies with email and structured invoice document access rules, AP
    Processors will no longer see invoices if they are not assigned to any Email or
    Structured Workflow Rules.
- cXML invoices with errors will now correctly appear for users configured in a
    structured access rule.
- Resolved a rounding issue with 50% distribution that prevented Payment
    Requests from posting successfully into the ERP system.
- Fixed an issue introduced into the line item modal in the last release that
    allowed service line items to be created with a \$0.00 price. It is once again no
    longer possible to have line items in the PR / PO with a \$0.00 price.
- Delivered a more appropriate error response when a cXML order confirmation
    was submitted for a Confirmed Order. The system previously returned a null
    pointer exception."

# Resolutions
- Improved Hopper Inbox document processing performance.
- Improved Terms & Conditions load time particularly where there were a
     significant number of Company Codes or Suppliers.
- Resolved an issue affecting Purchase Order status updates when receiving and
     canceling an ASN. When a user cancels the ASN and the PO's amount is within
     the 'Goods Receipt Threshold' limit, the system will correctly update the
     Purchase Order status to 'Confirmed' on both the Supplier Portal and Purchase
     Manager.)
- Fixed Invoice status issue where ""Paid"" in Great Plains was incorrectly showing
     ""Posted"" on the Vroozi invoice.
- For certain accounting and organizations Master Data objects; e.g. Cost Centers,
     GL Accounts etc. the system was displaying leading zeros despite the client
     having configured the system to NOT display these leading zeroes. This issue has

# Vroozi Catalog Content Management (Catalog Admins)
## CATALOG UPDATE PROCESSING PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
With this release, Vroozi improved catalog upload and processing. Previously, some
users experienced slower processing times when updating catalogs particularly when
there were a significant number of catalog versions. We overhauled our processing
logic to ensure more efficient handling of catalog updates. With this change, our
testing showed faster, more consistent, and more reliable performance no matter how
many catalog versions were in the system.
- Time Savings: Customers will get significantly reduced processing times, even for
      heavily updated catalogs.
- Consistency: The system will exhibit reliable performance regardless of how
      many catalog versions.
- Scalability: Customers will be able to handle frequent updates without worrying
      about diminishing system efficiency.

This enhancement will be available to all customers. No configuration change is
required.
# Resolutions
- The unread notification count on the bell icon (bottom left corner of the left
      navigation column) will now update automatically. The notification count will
      now update dynamically as new notifications arrive, ensuring accurate and
      real-time badge counts. No need to refresh the browser to update the count.
- Resolved an issue on the shopping cart screen where the Move to Request
      button remained enabled during processing, allowing multiple clicks and
      causing duplicate purchase requests. The button is now disabled after the
      request click until the operation is complete, preventing duplicates.
- Fixed an issue where updating the shipping address at the Purchase Request
      (PR) document level did not propagate the change to individual line items. The
      system now correctly replicates the updated address across all line items in the
      PR.
- The system now consistently removes leading zeroes on the UI as per the
   configuration to hide leading zeros, while retaining the leading zeros in the
   database."

# Vroozi Supplier Directory (Admin, Supplier Directory Admin, Supplier Directory Power User, Supplier Directory Basic User)
## USER GROUPS FOR SUPPLIER RECORD ACCESS CONTROL AND IMPROVED
# MAINTENANCE IN THE SUPPLIER DIRECTORY
User Groups deliver structured, role-based access and settings to the Vroozi Supplier
Directory.
To control access, users are assigned to a user group. Supplier records are then linked to
one or more user groups to control user visibility to the supplier record. The supplier bulk
upload/download now supports a User Group field so it can be used to assign supplier
records to user groups.
For better supplier record maintenance, Supplier Directory Admins can filter and manage
supplier records on the basis of User Groups.
